[{"title": "5 Common Excuses Keeping You From Breaking Into the Tech Field - Codeup", "content": "\nJust a few months before starting at Codeup in the Redwood cohort, I was sitting in the football stadium at the University of Colorado at Boulder, pondering what I would do after graduation. The commencement speaker that year was Kate Fagan, a sports reporter and commentator at ESPN. In her speech, something she said stuck out to me: \u201cTry replacing \u2018should\u2019 with \u2018want\u2019 and, as frequently as you are able, make decisions with that rubric. Life is best when your \u2018should\u2019 and your \u2018want\u2019 are aligned.\u201d Sitting there in that stadium, I realized that I knew exactly what I should be doing after graduating, which was applying to attend graduate school for the next five years. But the actual truth was, I didn\u2019t know what I truly wanted. Did I really want to jump into something for five years that I wasn\u2019t completely sure about? \nWith this in mind I moved to San Antonio after graduation, mostly to be closer to my family. One night at the dinner table, my brother-in-law mentioned several eye-catching billboards around town promoting a local coding bootcamp named Codeup. I had dabbled a bit in coding when I was in college, so my interest was immediately piqued. However, there were doubts nagging at the back of my mind. Am I even capable enough to attend an intensive coding bootcamp like this? I\u2019m not really a super logical person\u2026 Am I cut out for this? etc, etc. Despite having a ton of reservations about my capabilities and the usefulness of attending a boot camp, I decided to take a leap of faith. And just a year-and-a-half later, I celebrated my one year as a software developer at Armor in Richardson, TX. In some ways, it feels like a dream. The hard work I put in, the days and nights of impassioned coding, pushing through all the excuses\u2026 and finally landing a dream job?! It\u2019s a colorful blur. \nSo that\u2019s why in this post, I want to address five common excuses that may be keeping you from considering a career in technology. At the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t really make sense to let your fears and nagging doubts keep you from the job of your dreams.\n1. \u201cI\u2019m not cut out for a career in tech\u201d\n\nThis was one of the primary fears at the forefront of my mind when thinking about doing a complete shift to a technology career. And, as I went through Codeup, I heard this many times from my peers. To be honest, it doesn\u2019t ever fully go away. There are days even now at work where I think I\u2019m in over my head and that I don\u2019t belong there (Imposter Syndrome, anyone?). This fear completely disregards the fact that I\u2019m already doing it. The truth is, it isn\u2019t always easy. Technology is constantly changing, creating new problems and forcing those within the field to continuously find new solutions. At my company, even our most senior developers are learning something new every day. We all have our doubts sometimes, but those self-limiting beliefs shouldn\u2019t keep you from pursuing anything you set your mind to. \n2. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t fit in with engineers\u201d\n\nLet me ask you something. What does a veteran, electrical technician, and college music teacher have in common? Well, there was at least one of each in my cohort at Codeup, and all of them excelled and went on to become software developers. Other characters in my cohort included a stay-at-home-mom, barista, marketing professional, and a chef. All of these, however, are just arbitrary labels. None of these people told themselves \u201cI\u2019m just going to be a barista forever, because that\u2019s who I am\u201d or \u201cMy personality only suits being in a teacher, so I\u2019m not going to try something different.\u201d The reality is, our self-concept is always constantly shifting. There was such a colorful diversity of backgrounds, personalities, and skill sets at Codeup, proving that there\u2019s no one type or mold of individual that can pursue a technology career. \n3. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work alone all day staring at a computer screen\u201d\n\nThere are days where indeed this is the case for me, just \u201cheads down coding\u201d, but more often than not my days are filled with collaboration and communication with my teammates. When someone runs into a problem they don\u2019t have the knowledge to solve, they track down someone who does. When a few of us are working in the same codebase, we make sure to frequently communicate to make sure we\u2019re not stepping on each other\u2019s toes. On top of that, we get to be a part of producing the product, providing feedback and suggestions. There are very few days where I just sit at my desk all day, boring holes into my computer screen. Although my experience may certainly be atypical, the main point I\u2019m trying to make is that there is a large range of positions and cultures within the technology field. There are also other roles within the technology field beyond coding and data analytics, such as evangelists and solutions consultants. Both of these have lots of interaction with people and clients! Don\u2019t be afraid to try a few different things until you find your fit.\n4. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough experience\u201d\n\nMost of us at Codeup did not come in with prior experience in coding. The great thing about coding bootcamps is that they typically take you from 0 to 100 in a condensed period of time. They guide you through the entire process, allowing you to maximize your success, with everything from technical skills, networking, portfolio-building, and resume review. Even with bootcamps aside, there is a plethora of both paid and free resources online that give you the ability to learn a lot of the preliminary skills you would need. There are communities (e.g. Chingu) with the sole purpose of learning and building projects in new technologies. Experience can be gained, so seek out those resources. They\u2019re only a few keystrokes away. \nOne thing to note about the technology field is that it\u2019s becoming more and more heavily based on experience and not your formal education. Many companies will see the value in someone who has practical experience. The reality is that many companies are shifting towards seeking out individuals that can come in and hit the ground running with practical know-how instead of purely theoretical education. \n5. \u201cI\u2019m not tech savvy enough.\u201d\n\nAlthough basic computer skills are necessary for success, it\u2019s probably not as much as you think. And like I mentioned above, being able to excel in this field is all about embracing change and learning to learn. You may think you\u2019re not tech savvy because you always have issues with your radio or you can\u2019t get your apps to work right or you get frustrated with your computer software for not doing what you want it to \u2013 all of these things are valid struggles. Trust me, I\u2019ve been there. The reality is this: Many of these skills can be learned.\n\nAs you look into pursuing a career in the technology field, don\u2019t let these thought patterns keep you from getting where you want to be. Instead, ask yourself the real questions: Why do I want to do this? What kind of lifestyle do I see for myself? What am I passionate about? Excuses are excuses, not truths about you and your life. Set a vision and relentlessly pursue it, letting all these limiting beliefs slide off of you. They don\u2019t have to define your journey.\n\n\nJoyce Ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in Richardson, TX.

Knowing little to nothing about the city, I didn\u2019t know what to expect. All that had filtered down from the collective consciousness to my perception of the city was the obvious tourist attractions such as the Riverwalk, Alamo, and amazing Tex Mex. After spending a little under a year there, I came to fall in love with this city for reasons beyond what tourists can see in a weekend. The experience of its vibrant and proud Latino culture, flourishing art scene, and emphasis on community have left an indelible mark upon my life. \nAll this aside, a huge part of my experience in San Antonio was attending Codeup, a coding boot camp that allowed me to have the skills needed to make a complete career shift and also an insider\u2019s look into San Antonio\u2019s flourishing tech community. For those of you that have never had a local\u2019s perspective into the technology layer of San Antonio, I\u2019m here to explain five reasons you should consider beginning a data science career here.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a01. San Antonio is a tech hotspot.\nAlthough San Antonio is usually overshadowed by its northern neighbor Austin, it is actually a humble but bustling tech hotspot according to Inc., a weekly business magazine. Especially as Austin\u2019s infrastructure struggles to support its rapid expansion and population growth, corporations and talent have begun to siphon off to San Antonio, which is only an hour south. Cost-of-living is much lower compared to Austin and is an attractive option for anyone starting out in entry-level data science. Additionally, a 2018 CBRE report names San Antonio in the top 50 US markets for tech talent, and is rapidly rising. On top of that, San Antonio ranked first among small tech markets in millennial population growth, with 12.5 percent between 2011 and 2016. Brookings found even greater growth, more than 14 percent, among millennials in a January report. Where the talent goes, corporations will follow. \n\u00a0\u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Big corporations in San Antonio are hiring for data science roles. \nPeople may not realize it, but San Antonio is home to lots of large corporations such as USAA, HEB, Accenture, Hulu, iHeartMedia, Booz Allen \u2014 the list goes on. A quick Google search for data science jobs in San Antonio will pull up over a hundred active openings, all from corporations like the ones listed above. Additionally, SA Works conducted an analysis of over 30 business and thousands of job posts and has projected a higher growth in local tech jobs in San Antonio than the national average. Many of the corporations named above were found to be actively hiring for these positions. Data Science is also considered one of the best jobs in America for 2019, which makes it especially attractive with San Antonio\u2019s affordable cost of living.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. San Antonio has a tight-knit tech community.\nA tight-knit community means that it is much more accessible for individuals to find resources that will aid them towards their goals, i.e. to become a data scientist. With even just a few months in San Antonio, I was able to see how welcoming and supporting the tech community is. With tech conferences, meetups, workshops, hackathons, and startup competitions galore, the community is truly thriving. The hub of a lot of this activity is Geekdom, a coworking space that serves as the central place for technology nerds to gather. Much of this community has a united vision to see technology flourish in San Antonio. For example, Tech Bloc was an organization created to advocate for policies that attract technology companies and talent to San Antonio. Even Codeup itself was created in order to produce more tech talent in San Antonio and drive growth. With so many determined and passionate technology stakeholders in San Antonio, its growth is inevitable! \n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. San Antonio\u2019s cloud and security sector are well-renowned. \nWhen I say \u201cwell-renowned\u201d, it\u2019s not because the majority of people talk about it. The thing about security is that\u2026 it\u2019s typically discreet. However, San Antonio is actually the\u00a0home of dozens of security startups, and some of the most prominent ones are nowhere near household names except perhaps for those that are familiar with the industry. Many of these companies would do well to not draw attention to themselves due to the nature of the work. In conjunction, the University of Texas at San Antonio has three separate cybersecurity centers, and one of them is the top-ranked program in the nation. In general, cybersecurity spending is growing globally, and this will, in turn, benefit the tech growth in San Antonio. \u00a0\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. The city is invested in growing technologically. \u00a0\nGrowing up, I would hear my parents tell me that you need to look at someone\u2019s wallet to know who they truly are. That is, it\u2019s important to know how someone spends their money. One way to tell that San Antonio cares about technology is seeing how the city invests in technology initiatives. For example, there\u2019s WiFi in eight of the city parks, solar-powered smartphone charging attached to benches, and even drones assisting in search and rescue operations. Additionally, the city and Bexar County have addressed the tech gap by budgeting up to 300,000 dollars to create a role for a chief talent and recruitment officer (CTRO). This individual, along with the local nonprofit Tech Bloc which administers the position, has a job that is two-fold: bringing in outside tech talent and matching local talent to organizations. \n\nIn many ways, San Antonio is a city that many people seem to underestimate. I showed up without high hopes, dreading the Texas heat and bad drivers. However, it\u2019s a place that I ended up finding some of my closest friends, along with a diverse community and thriving tech industry. Plus, it doesn\u2019t hurt that it\u2019s dubbed the Taco capital of the US. \n\n\u2014\n\nJoyce Ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in Richardson, TX.

So, what do you do? You plop down on the couch, whip out your phone and Google \u201crestaurants near me\u201d. You scroll down the list of places to eat and take into account a variety of factors: how high the ratings are, how many people have rated that restaurant, how far it is from you, whether or not it\u2019s busy at that moment, the keywords mentioned in reviews, how long it\u2019s open\u2026 the list goes on. You carefully bookmark each prospective restaurant so you can find it later. All of a sudden, you notice that without your knowledge, three hours have slipped by. You realize with a feeling of dread in your stomach that nearly all the restaurants around you are closed\u2026 and you head over to the nearest Whataburger in defeat. \nA week later, life finds you in the same supine position on the couch, scrolling through restaurants. This time, though, you realize there\u2019s a little compatibility rating next to each restaurant listing. As you scroll, you stumble upon a sushi restaurant that apparently is 90% compatible with your preferences. Without hesitation, you rush there with glee to find that it is everything you could have hoped for! Wow! Data science saves the day!\n\nThis very relatable experience is a prime example of how many of us have experienced data science in our lives without realizing it. Let\u2019s take a quick moment to analyze how data science played the protagonist in this story. It is important to note that data science is a broad subject that encompasses a variety of things, including first gathering and shaping data, storing that data, then analyzing and visually presenting that data. \n\u00a0\nHow Google Does It\nBefore we can start analyzing data, Google data scientists must first be able to gather information about everything from restaurant locations, hours, pricing, customer reviews, etc. Next, this massive influx of data must be efficiently manipulated and organized so it can quickly be retrieved, Marie Kondo style. Data scientists are then able to take and analyze this data and visually translate it into something that makes sense, such as the graph that displays the busiest hours at the restaurant, or the tidy list of restaurants you see in the app that is ordered by distance from you.\n\nA simple action such as filtering by \u201cOpen Now\u201d or \u201cPrice\u201d requires a tight coordination of all of these steps in order to actually produce the output expected by the user. Amazingly, Google Maps is able to do this analysis real-time to constantly change its results based on your current location. Not only that, it is simultaneously analyzing every single person\u2019s GPS data real-time. This allows them to generate components like the graph of how busy an establishment is at the moment.\n\u00a0\nGoogle Maps, A Man\u2019s Best Friend\nAnother important factor in data science is using analysis to drive predictions (Read more here about the difference between data analytics and data science). For example, in calculating compatibility ratings, the program takes into account Google location history, search history, types of cuisine/restaurants you typically visit or avoid, whether you\u2019ve saved/rated/visited a place or somewhere similar, or simply data that a user inputs about their dietary preferences. It also allows for constant feedback from the user if a compatibility rating seems off, with a \u201cNot Right?\u201d link attached to every rating. In other words, this rating is a prediction of how much you would like a restaurant based on your past history and behavior. \nSo how exactly has Google mastered this compatibility rating? Most likely, data scientists at Google have created algorithms to take the pieces of information listed above to produce a prediction. Essentially, it\u2019s a way for a computer program to act more human. For example, think about how you recommend a show to your best friend. Most likely, you know your friend\u2019s personality and history of shows that they\u2019ve enjoyed, so you generally know what kind of show they may like watching. \nSimilarly, data scientists can use algorithms and statistical models to write code that continuously \u201clearns\u201d to make better predictions, creating an adaptable learning machine. With machine learning and artificial intelligence, Google is able to generate friendly human-like recommendations for over a billion people every single month, which is probably better than what your best friend could do.\n\n\nWhen Robots Take Over the World\nAs the data science field continues to progress and we get closer and closer to true artificial intelligence, we will most likely see the effects of that trickle down into the parts of our everyday life that we hardly consider. We already trust the algorithms and generated recommendations that suggest where or when to eat. Eventually, even something as vital as a life-altering surgery will be dictated by recommendations generated by algorithms for doctors. Understanding and learning about data science will become more significant as it gradually becomes enmeshed with society in ways we may not even be able to fully comprehend.

As a requirement for my Math degree, I took an Intro to Java class. I enjoyed it so much and was tempted to switch majors. However, I was a semester away from graduation and decided not to. Coding was still something I wanted to do so I tried some online courses. \nThe online classes were satisfactory, but it made me realize two things: 1) I didn\u2019t know what I needed to be learning and 2) whatever I did learn, I needed to be in a classroom setting to learn it. I heard about Codeup and other coding bootcamps and added myself to Codeup\u2019s mailing list. However, both the price and the thought of having to quit my job scared me from ever applying. I found a cheaper coding school and attended one of their coding workshops, but didn\u2019t like the way the workshop was run. The instructors only gave us lines of code to write with little theory behind it. That combined with poor organization in general made me realize that was not the place for me. I went back to Codeup\u2019s website and read about their curriculum. I liked how theory as well as practical usage was taught. I was also liked seeing how much help was available to students from instructors and student fellows. However, the biggest question still on my mind was, \u201cWill I get a job afterwards?\u201d\nI learned that the curriculum at Codeup is developed with input from tech companies, which means that Codeup is teaching important skills that employers are actually looking for. Incidentally, the curriculum changed a bit a few months before I started due to employers\u2019 requests. An added bonus on the job front was an in-house liaison between students and employers. Codeup\u2019s Director of Product, Stephen Salas, has connections with several companies and he always know which ones are looking for developers fresh out of school. I decided to take a chance and applied even though I was still worried about the financial part of it. When I got accepted, I found out that there are many scholarships and programs to help ease the financial burden. I qualified for some of these even though I thought I wouldn\u2019t. Many more scholarships and grants have been added since I left Codeup thus lowering the barrier to attend. I graduated in May 2018 and am currently working as a developer specializing in data extraction and transformation. I love what I\u2019m doing now. My only regret is that I didn\u2019t do this sooner.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\nJoin Us_ \n\nWe're excited to launch our new Codeup newsletter, which highlights some interesting blog posts, things in the know, and upcoming events.

With the start of this cohort, we launched a new blog series: the Codeup Student Check In. We\u2019ll interview a student over the course of the 4.5 months to see how things are progressing from first impressions all the way to graduation. Thus, welcome to the Codeup Student Check In: Month 3!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCodeup: How has your experience been at Codeup so far? \nWrangell Student: I\u2019ve had a great experience so far. Everything has been what I imagined and more. I have learned things in a short amount of time that otherwise would\u2019ve taken me months upon months to learn. The people here are some of the kindest and most supportive people that I\u2019ve met in a long time, and I\u2019m happy to have this experience in my life. \nC: Describe what you\u2019re learning right now. Is it hard/fun/challenging? \nS: We\u2019ve just started our capstone project which is the final hurrah of our Codeup experience. We are in the planning stages and it\u2019s honestly a little overwhelming due to the sheer amount of information we\u2019re communicating to our teammates and because of the volume of work that\u2019s going to be done over this next week or two. Nonetheless, I am excited by the challenge and I know that our final project is going to be something that I will be really proud of and really happy to have been a part of. I\u2019m excited to see how it will all pan out. \nC: How has the learning process/information gathering been?\nS: I love doing research and the focus of my research has shifted from solely academic to a balance between academic and professional. I am still researching new technologies as well as doing further research into the current curriculum but now I am also doing research into potential companies I\u2019d like to work with. I\u2019m interested in their mission and if their goals align with mine, both short and long term.\nC:What has been the most memorable part of this month?\nS:The most memorable part of this month has been actually shopping for new interview outfits, looking at myself in the mirror, and seeing a young professional. This has been one of my long-term goals and it\u2019s a great experience seeing it come to fruition.\nC:How do you feel your skill level compares to last month? \nS: I think my skill levels are increasing each month. Now that we are going into full stack applications I can finally see the cumulative success of my time here.\nC: How have the instructors and staff been helpful? Have you started working with the placement side of Codeup? If so, can you elaborate on that? \nS: I am grateful for the mock interview process with the instructors. It\u2019s really helpful to have your instructors grade you on your performance and prep you for real world interviews. These instructors all have some sort of practical experience and firsthand knowledge of the professional world. Their experience and advice is invaluable.\nC: Did you learn anything new at Codeup that you weren\u2019t expecting? \nS: I wasn\u2019t expecting to learn as many people skills as I did. I thought this was strictly a technical school and this really came as a surprise. I have really learned how to network and how to talk to people that I otherwise would have been scared to talk to. I\u2019ve learned that people are people, just humans, and improving conversational skills to talk with them is valuable. Learning the value of a human connection in the professional world is a very exciting thing.\nC: Have you been interviewing for jobs? What has that been like? If not, do you know what type of role you are looking for? (Ie. Developer, Q/A, Tech sales, Tech Ed, etc)\nS: I\u2019ve had a few interviews this weekend and they have been very exciting and stressful. Having interviews back to back is both a blessing and a curse. It\u2019s important to destress at home and really be aware of your emotions and reactions to stress. Time management is another big challenge. How much time do I put into studying versus interview prep? How much time can I dedicate to other life roles and be a good girlfriend, good daughter, and good pet owner while still fulfilling my role as a student and job seeker? These challenges are tough to overcome, and this is where emotional awareness can really help.\nC: If you can give one piece of advice to any prospective students, what would it be? \nS: Really do your research. Know what you\u2019re getting into. You can\u2019t go into anything blind! Get as much knowledge as you can so you can thoroughly prepare for and enjoy this journey. A great plan will save you a lot of suffering in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\nJoin Us_ \n\nWe're excited to launch our new Codeup newsletter, which highlights some interesting blog posts, things in the know, and upcoming events.

I still remember thinking that my grandmothers\u2019 flip phone in 1995 was the coolest thing I had ever seen. As a child, I took all my electronic toys apart, because I was curious what was inside. So you can say, I always yearned for a career in tech.\nMy name is Sukari Schutzman. I don\u2019t take myself too seriously, I\u2019m always laughing, and trying to share positive energy, but most importantly I am a software developer.\nWhen I got my cosmetology license, I was passionate about doing hair. I wanted to learn how to be better, and how to perfect my craft. In many ways, I see a lot of parallels in cosmetology, and in software development. Drawing those parallels kept me strong in the program and reminded me to never give up. I remembered when I was in cosmetology school, or when I was in the salon and I was stuck on something, I always asked for help. In software development and at Codeup, the same rings true.\nI had always driven by the billboards on I-10 on my way into San Antonio and was ALWAYS confused. \u201cSoftware Developer? Why is \u2018Retail Manager\u2019 crossed out? What is that?\u201d, I always wondered. But I always continued to drive on and thought nothing of it when I reached my destination.\nI decided development was for me and wanted to transition into it and learn how to code, as I had been exposed to it for a while. I knew self-study would not work for me. I needed to be in a classroom and knew I needed to be in front of an instructor. But most importantly, I needed a job ASAP because I needed to support myself and my child.\nWhen I arrived at Codeup and went on the tour I was amazed. I knew this would be the place for me, and it was going to be where I knew my life would change. I was going to be walking out of one door and into another. And I wasn\u2019t going to look back.\nWhen I found out that I had got in, I was so happy that my hard work paid off and I knew it was just the beginning of what was to come. I looked forward to the start date and marked it on my calendar. I also quit my job, which was much needed because salon life was stressful enough, let alone learning a new skill.\nThe next few months were filled with triumphs and failures, which is normal in any career. No one is born good at everything, it takes practice and determination (I totally had to repeat that to myself every single day at Codeup. Thanks Ryan!). Sometimes it felt like two steps back, but I was determined to make it to Demo Day and present my Capstone.\nWith the help of Codeup staff, I felt setup to succeed at Demo Day. But most of all, I felt prepared for my new career.\nDemo Day finally came! Our project got the most compliments on the visual interface, which I worked hard on, and helped us stand out amongst our classmates. I had a few interviews set up for within a week after Demo Day and landed my first job. At this point, I was in awe. Everything I worked hard for had finally came to fruition. And most of all, I didn\u2019t have to work weekends unless I wanted to.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being hair stylist, absolutely not! However, it just wasn\u2019t for me anymore. Thanks to Codeup, my life is so different now.\nAnd for that, I am eternally grateful.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\nJoin Us_ \n\nWe're excited to launch our new Codeup newsletter, which highlights some interesting blog posts, things in the know, and upcoming events.

Eldest: Entrepreneur with several successful businesses; Second: Contract Law Lawyer; Third: Doctor of Neonatal Genetics; Fourth (Me): cooked since I was 15. Although the decision to make a career of cooking didn\u2019t hit me for a few years, I had known that I did not want to follow the footsteps of my parents or siblings.\nCooking\nAt the age of 19, I decided that I wanted to attend college at the prestigious Culinary Institute of America (CIA). Before I could finalize my decision, I knew I had to tell my parents. They reacted just as I thought they would. \u201cWhat?! NO, NEVER! Never in my life did I ever think my son would become a cook.\u201d Our family comes from a culture where there are three acceptable career paths: Doctors, Lawyers, and Engineers. Coming from a family where I already had a sibling fulfilling each of those roles, I felt that I had nothing to prove to anyone except myself. I ended up attending CIA and working in the industry for 15 years. Having held every role in a kitchen and marriage, including being a parent, I decided it was time to put my ego aside, think about what\u2019s best for my family, and transition careers.\nThe Most Important Thing\nEarly on in my cooking career, I had a mentor that drilled a simple phrase into my head: \u201cThe most important thing in life is to figure out what is most important.\u201d This simple saying spoke very loudly to me; how can you work towards a goal if you don\u2019t know what the goal is? Every task I would work on in life would ring those words in my head; So what was most important to me? \u201cA happy family and nothing else\u201d is what I have defined as what is most important. Now it\u2019s time to figure out how to get there.\nThe First Step: Codeup Open House\nAfter spending too much time on autopilot, it was then that I realized the only thing keeping me in the restaurant industry was that it was the only thing I really knew. I needed to break the mold to be able to achieve the most important thing. Having always been computer savvy and a self-proclaimed problem solver, I soon realized that I was better with computers than I thought. It seemed to come more naturally to me than others, which was when I realized I needed to find a career that would allow me to use my skills in computers. There was only one clear answer for me, and that was Codeup. I spent time at their open house, and I was sold. Not only were they kind and caring individuals, but also extremely smart and talented developers and teachers. It seemed like the right answer.\nThe Second Step: \u201cGood\u201d\nAfter getting through the admissions process and getting accepted, I decided to make the best of my decision to attend and set a plan of action to take in as much as possible. I made note cards, studied ahead, built random projects I found online, and ran code kata\u2019s everyday. Sounds impressive, but I can assure you, there was much failure involved. If I was struggling, \u201cGood\u201d would tend to be my response because with failure comes the opportunity to get better; it meant that there was something that I needed to work on. As the difficulty level strengthened, so did the number of \u201cGood\u201d moments. There were moments when doubt and worry went through my mind as well. I was worried that I had made the wrong move. \u00a0I turned to my classmates with the plea for help, they responded similarly as well. \u201cWhat a relief,\u201d I thought. It was good to know that I wasn\u2019t the only one in class struggling because it made me realized I tricked myself into thinking that I was couldn\u2019t do it. \nFinding a Job with Only Cooking Experience\nAfter graduating from Codeup and being fully aware of my imposter syndrome, I could not shake the thought of why someone would hire me. I would have to constantly remind myself that, with the skills I had from my previous work experiences and the new skills I learned over the past 18 weeks, I was more than capable. With the help of the Director of Product, Stephen Salas, I was able to find a job within one week of graduating.\nGoal Achieved: Now What? Maintain and Gain Skills\nI got the knowledge, got the job, and got the work/life balance. Now what? Now it\u2019s time to continue to learn and advance with your newly learned skills. One thing I realized after going through the Codeup program was that there are a lot of similarities between learning to code and learning to cook. At first, basic skills require a lot of effort and struggle, but eventually they become second nature. After the basics are understood and the muscle memory is built, then comes the never ending list of more advanced skills. When people ask me what the best part of Codeup is, I tend to respond simply with, \u201cthey taught me how to learn\u201d. I look at new projects that I am given and when I have no idea where to start, I say \u201cGood\u201d, another opportunity to get better.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\nJoin Us_ \n\nWe're excited to launch our new Codeup newsletter, which highlights some interesting blog posts, things in the know, and upcoming events.

My code was very error prone and I created some functions that I was expecting a string as the output but I got an object. It was very frustrating and I wasn\u2019t even sure I would be able to understand software development let alone have to go and fix my code. My nightmare scenario was to be hired on as a developer and then have to troubleshoot, a.k.a. debug, some other developers code\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31. I think most junior developers have had shared my fear at some point in their career. I was taught to heavily rely upon outputting your results to the console whether its good or bad to help troubleshoot.\nIn this post I will do my best to help calm the fears of my fellow junior developers with helpful debugging tools and hopefully transition away from relying upon\u00a0console.log(). While my focus will be on JavaScript these tools can easily be translated to other languages.\nLogging output to the console isn\u2019t always\u00a0helpful\nFor the longest time\u00a0console.log()\u00a0was my go-to when I needed to debug JavaScript code. It was my developer friend who told me what was wrong with my code and was never judgemental\u00a0. I will admit that there are few scenarios where it is \u201cOK\u201d to output the results of a function to the console.\nExcept more recently, I have found using\u00a0console.log()\u00a0to be less useful when debugging\u00a0and only making things worse by expecting a good outcome and then disappointing me. Like an expired $5 Amazon Gift Card (Thanks, grandma). Take for example, this gem:\nObject doesn't support property or method 'from'\nThat lovely error is from IE 11 which does not support Array.from(node List) prototype without a shim/poly fill that is available\u00a0here.\nHowever, I have come to find out that logging errors to the console is either inefficient or completely irrelevant to what may actually be causing the problem in your code. I will admit that some errors are easily resolved by reading the output of the error message and fixing the typo or following the instructions of the error message to help resolve the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo in the image above we are shown a node item which has so many properties that you might not be aware of, which renders console.log useless. You have to know ahead of time what value or specific attribute you are trying to output which requires some abstract thinking or referencing documentation to identify this property. Now using the console.log will output all the entire properties of the node item but its an unnecessary step to add in this line of code while you debug and then go back and remove the line of code.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know\u201d -Bill Parcel (Head Coach New England Patriots)\n\nThe error the console outputs might provide you with the location of the error, but you may not know why are you getting the error in the first place. Maybe you\u2019re passing the incorrect value to the function or you are working with event handling and\u00a0bubbling events.\nEither way, chances are that you aren\u2019t thinking about that one property that is actually passing the value your expecting because you weren\u2019t aware of how to call it or pass it along.\nI\u2019m going to piggy back off of\u00a0Mozilla\u2019s Debug Playground\u00a0as an example for why you shouldn\u2019t use the console and instead use the Browsers built-in debugger or equally as helpful is an IDE\u2019s built-in debugger.\ncough cough\u00a0Visual Studio Code\u00a0cough cough\n\u00a0Now, whether you prefer Chrome over FireFox is a whole different can-o-worms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDE Tools and Online\u00a0REPLs\n\n\u201cHey man, I\u2019m a back-end developer and so I need to console.log\u201d\n-Fictional Backend Developer\n\nSo maybe you don\u2019t have a fully fleshed out web form or you\u2019re trying to get data from some API or JSON file. You need to see data from the function you\u2019re writing or better yet you want to test a function that someone else wrote without having to clone the entire project. Using\u00a0console.log()\u00a0seems like the go to. In fact,\u00a0around \u00be of Node.js developers report using it\u00a0(in 2017) for finding errors in their applications.\nI\u2019m here to tell you of a few better ways to debug your code.\nIDE Tools\nThe first tool I have come to love and trust is one made by a company called\u00a0Wallaby.js\nQuokkaJS (Integrated Scratchpad for JavaScript)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this plug-in you can write your code and get immediate results. No need to throw in a bunch of console.log\u2019s in your function and check the output. It has an integration for\u00a0VSCode\u00a0(\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96 ),\u00a0JetBrainsIDE\u00a0and\u00a0Atom. I personally have purchased a pro license but for the most part the community version will work just fine.\nSonarLint\u00a0( Like spellcheck but for your code)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think all developers should have some sort of code linting tool added into their IDE. This helps review your code in real-time and \u201cshould\u201d prevent you from compiling or running code with errors in it. I\u2019ve chosen SonarLint because its given me better results than ES6 linter or some other linting tools that i\u2019ve tried. I\u2019m not saying its the best or that the others don\u2019t work but I haven\u2019t had to configure much other than just installing the extension.\nScratchpad (Built-in Browser Javascript sandbox)\nMozilla also offers a feature in their\u00a0DevTools\u00a0that allows you to write, run, and view the output of JavaScript code that can interact with the current web page or not.\nREPLs\nI have a background in\u00a0.NET development and I have fallen in love with\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s F# Language\u00a0along with the\u00a0fsharp community. While going through the documentation I was introduced to a new term, REPL.\nREPL stands for:\u00a0Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.\n\u201c In a REPL, the user enters one or more expressions (rather than an entire\u00a0compilation unit) and the REPL evaluates them and displays the results.\u201d -Wikipedia\nSo I thought, this was cool and I used my Googliness\u2122\ufe0f to search for an online version or service and so I came upon THIS.\n\nREPL.IT\n\nI don\u2019t need to console.log my output or assign the function to\u00a0var result = greeting()\u00a0and then\u00a0console.log(greeting(\"Jessica\"))\u00a0. I just write my function, invoke it and BOOM! I get the output without the need of\u00a0console.log()\u00a0.\n\nRepl.it supports many languages!\n\n\nI can even create a Repl, write some code and share the link with someone that can give me feedback, Brilliant!\nCoincidentally, Repl.it uses\u00a0Monaco, which is the same Editor that VSCode uses.\nFinally, for the developer on a budget (including myself) most popular IDEs have a built-in debugger that works the same was as the debugger in Chrome or Firefox.\nI\u2019ve kindly added links to How-Tos: For a few IDEs (don\u2019t get mad if your IDE is not listed, I\u2019m looking at you Atom IDE community).\nDebugging in VSCode\u00a0\nDebugging in JetBrains IntelliJ\nDebugging in Visual Studio\nFinal Thoughts\nSo why have I gone through the long winded trouble of explaining / trying to convince you why you should wean yourself off of using the console.log and embrace debugging tools? How was this suppose to make you feel better / more confident in writing code?\nThe short answer is:\u00a0I believe having more information and proper tools \u201cshould\u201d make coding, and for that matter debugging, less daunting / scary.\nUse of widely available, open-source debugging tools is key to be more familiar with software development and to grow as a developer.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\nJoin Us_ \n\nWe're excited to launch our new Codeup newsletter, which highlights some interesting blog posts, things in the know, and upcoming events.

Each student had a duck at their seat on the first day of our 18 \u00bd week advanced full stack web development boot camp. The expression of each duck varied, but they all stared quietly and blankly at us as we took in our surroundings with excitement and anticipation. At the time, I had no idea what it was for or why we needed that bath time friend. Now I do.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPart of what I love about programming is the problem-solving. However, in the attempt to figure out a software solution the developer very often can get tunnel vision \u2013 stuck on solving a problem the same wrong way or just get stumped with no real direction. This is where rubber duck debugging is the most useful. It originated from a book called \u201cThe Pragmatic Programmer\u201d by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas.\nRubber duck debugging is simple. It includes taking the problem you are trying to solve and explaining it out loud to the rubber duck. This may seem silly because most of us have not talked to inanimate objects since we were kids. However, by doing this it forces a developer to think in a different way and to look at an issue under a microscope. Talking out loud activates a different part of the human brain, which very often helps the developer solve a problem without ever talking to another person. It keeps us from wasting our own time and the time of others when the solution is right at our fingertips.\nI have experienced this phenomenon myself when I try to explain aspects of programming to people who are not programmers. It forces me to think of programming in a different way. I have to lose the acronyms, and just speak plain English to a person who isn\u2019t such an avid techie like myself. When I do that I walk away with new knowledge and a refreshed passion for what I have been discussing.\nPhoto: Photos By Marvin Pfeiffer / Staff Photographer\nI also learned later that the rubber duck is the official mascot for Codeup. His name is Codey and he has a special meaning to me beyond just rubber duck debugging. I began to sketch him on the first day of class. Over time he began to express my struggles and triumphs while learning to code. He came alive for me and became a student of Codeup alongside me during my time there. If I had a bad day, he totally understood because he was in the fire with me. If I struggled to understand a concept, he got that too and listened while I talked to him about what I was trying to do. Now, as a proud graduate of Codeup working as a software developer at a fantastic company, I keep Codey with me. He is in my car and at my desk at work. He also sits on my desk at home \u2013 waiting patiently to hear my struggles and what I am trying to solve for that day.\nIf you do not have a rubber duck for debugging, I suggest you go out and get one!\n"}, {"title": "From the Service Industry to Software Development - Codeup", "content": "\nBy Randi Mays\n\nFor many teenagers, the path to self-reliance starts in one of two places: a restaurant or retail store. Until it\u2019s time to begin a professional career, you\u2019re working that part-time job stocking shelves, helping irate customers with expired coupons or prepping for the dinner rush. I\u2019d venture to say I\u2019m one of the very few who was sad to leave that lifestyle behind.\nI worked in the food service and retail industries for 10 years before I attended Codeup. I took great pride in my work every day; I couldn\u2019t go home until everything was near perfect: my work area spotless, the shelves neatly stocked and everything ready for the next shift. When it came time to leave the service industry and move on to professional work, I was initially reluctant. I had found great personal fulfillment and success in customer service. Why would I want to leave? \nI have big dreams. Of course I want to travel the world, spending my vacations in exotic destinations, trying new foods, seeing centuries-old architecture, and making lasting memories. But more importantly, I wanted to work for a company with a more widespread mission than gastronomic satisfaction. I wanted to work alongside people with a passion for their work that ran far deeper than a paycheck.\nAfter graduating from Codeup in September 2016, I began working for USAA as a software developer and I can tell you\u2013the company is no stranger to giving. Each employee receives company paid volunteer hours and I used some of mine to volunteer at the San Antonio Food Bank among dozens of other USAA employees. Last year when Hurricane Harvey hit, USAA was quick to organize several volunteer sessions at their home campus to prepare food and other basic necessities to be delivered to people in need. They even have a system where I can automatically deduct a specified amount from my paycheck to give to charitable causes I am passionate about. I have heard story after story about their representatives on the phone going above and beyond their duties to serve members in combat zones and at home. I can\u2019t enumerate here all of the reasons I admire USAA for its community involvement and caring, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve made my point.\nThere are times I look back on my experience in food service and retail nostalgically, remembering how I excelled in those positions and enjoyed the repetitive work. Then I come back to the present and remember how big an impact my employer makes serving the military community and their families, and how many lives are changed by the work I do with my team. I find great personal satisfaction and pride in my work every day, and I am just getting started.\n"}, {"title": "Codeup Student Check In: Month 2 - Codeup", "content": "\n\u00a0\n\nCodeup welcomed our newest cohort, the Wrangell cohort, on July 23. With the start of this cohort, we are launching a new blog series: the Codeup Student Check In. We\u2019ll interview a student over the course of the 4.5 months to see how things are progressing from first impressions all the way to graduation. Thus, welcome to the Codeup Student Check In: Month 2!\nWe took the time to sit down with our Wrangell student to see how they\u2019ve been doing so far!\nCodeup: Describe what you\u2019re learning right now. Is it hard/fun/challenging? \nWrangell Student: In this section of the curriculum we are learning about the basics of Java and the building blocks that make up the language. This language is more verbose than previous material, and one of the hardest parts is understanding the instructions and translating them to code. \nC: How has the learning process/information gathering been?\nS: A wide variety of resources are available. In addition to the curriculum, I utilize the Head First Java book and the Oracle documentation. Another challenge is combining the knowledge from all these resources into one.\nC: How do you feel your skill level compares to last month? \nS: Comparing my skill level now with that of last month is no contest. Everyone around me is improving as well and I am excited to see my classmates skill levels growing. Our skills are improving exponentially!\nC: How have the instructors and staff been helpful?\nS: The instructors hold study hall before class and after to give us extra help. They\u2019re constantly posting resources in our slack channel and encouraging us to ask questions. They have no problem going back to review material or clarify any questions we have. At the same time, they encourage our learning. They don\u2019t give us the answer if it\u2019s obvious or an easily searchable question.\nC: Share a fun experience you had at Codeup!\nOur great staff gave us some very cool thermoses. I\u2019m a diehard sticker fan. I immediately ordered coding and anime related stickers for this thermos and they\u2019re going straight on the thermos the moment they come in!\nC: What has been the most memorable part of this month and has anything exciting happened?\nS: Codeup expanded onto the 6th floor of the Vogue building, so we\u2019re coding in a totally different environment. It\u2019s full of natural light, which makes me very happy. I personally love heights so it\u2019s great to look out the windows while taking a break from coding.\nSomething exciting that happened was that I got my first star! Instructors give us stars for asking good questions. I\u2019m the type of person who needs to google the answer first before asking something. I wouldn\u2019t want to ask something that is easily available on the internet. However, Java is very challenging, and I just needed to ask questions and I got a star! Super exciting!\n\u00a0\n"}, {"title": "Codeup\u2019s Data Science Career Accelerator is Here! - Codeup", "content": "\nThe rumors are true! The time has arrived.

Starting my computing career at Trinity University has proven to be extremely important; all the hours spent on algorithm design, data structures, logic are all essential in what I\u2019m doing now. However, it is not an uncommon idea that what colleges teach can sometimes be at an offset to industry demands. I experienced this significant gap between employer expectations and my computing skill-set post college, and with the\u00a0I-need-a-job-to-get-experience-to-work-for-a-job-that-requires-experience\u00a0catch that most college graduates experience the first few years of leaving academia, I found myself struggling to find employment. The first year of leaving my university was a humbling yet soul-crushing experience. Why is it that I\u2019ve pursued a degree directly related to such a hungry market for software developers, but I am unable to find a job? Among what seemed like an endless stream of interviews in which I partook, I began to notice a trend \u2013 I lacked full stack development experience with relevant programming languages that are currently in demand. Turns out, having the theoretical knowledge isn\u2019t enough for most employers in the market. The industry of software development has evolved throughout the years of its existence, and with its evolution came new programming languages that better suit the needs of its users and the customers it will eventually serve. Ultimately, logical thinking did not trump most self-taught HTML, CSS, Javascript developers that fill the market with highly innovative ideas and projects.\nAs a Trinity graduate who still lived in San Antonio after graduating, I learned more about Codeup from peers who contributed to the curriculum and program\u2019s growth. Some of my classmates in my department also attended the program and found great opportunities within the industry upon graduating the program. At first, I was skeptical of the value Codeup could bring to someone like me who already had experience in programming, albeit in languages that weren\u2019t exactly in demand. But, being unemployed and discouraged for seemingly an eternity, I decided to give it a go.\nThe program was an introduction to programming, which is very different from my experience in college. Since I was verbose in the structure and characteristics of software development, it was easily digestible. The curriculum consisted of introductions to different programming languages, and most importantly, showed me how everything pieced together to form working and aesthetically pleasing products that definitely had the potential to be client facing projects that serve the public. It was an eye-opening experience for me: seeing and experiencing web development with relevant technologies like MVC, ES6, and the Spring Framework. As most of the course material were quickly grasped by my existing mode of thinking, I spent most of my time on the assignments, perfecting them and pushing myself to create difficult effects or programs. The instructors were all extremely helpful and understanding of my background, and were even nice enough to provide me with bonus assignments to push what I\u2019ve learned to its limits.\nI never would have guessed that Codeup would benefit me in the way it did. Within a week of graduating, I found a job as a Salesforce Developer at a consulting company here in San Antonio. Together with the knowledge I\u2019ve obtained from my degree, I have put everything I learned at Codeup to use: creating real products used by thousands of real users. I wouldn\u2019t be here without the experience I had, not just with the curriculum, but with the excellent career placement staff at Codeup. As clich\u00e9 as it may sound, the benefits I\u2019ve gotten from the program that acted as supplements to my degree don\u2019t fall far from being life-changing, and I would encourage those who have experienced the same struggles as me in this competitive market to give it a go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "5 Things Codeup Doesn\u2019t Tell You - Codeup", "content": "\nI remember during my first day of Codeup I began to doubt my ability to overcome the challenges that lay ahead.\u00a0I soon learned that what I was experiencing was \u201cimpostor syndrome.\u201d Jason Straughan, Codeup\u2019s CEO, introduced us to this phenomenon that same day. Thanks to his kind advice I was able to identify, and overcome my doubts.\u00a0Codeup shared many valuable lessons with me, but some lessons were taught through exposure outside of the Vogue building. If you decide to enroll at Codeup, you will find yourself learning many things outside the classroom.\u00a0I realized through my own journey that there are things Codeup didn\u2019t tell me. So, I\u2019ve narrowed it down to the 5 main things I had to learn on my own as a newly placed software developer.\nYou Need to be Multilingual\n\nYou need to be adaptable and willing to open your ears to all ideas. They say the best way to learn a different language is through practice. In most of our professional and non-professional lives, relationships will have an assigned lingo to properly cater to that relationship. Furthermore, professional groups and organizations like projectQUEST, H-E-B, and Codeup have their own kind of language. These languages are used to identify and recognize individuals of that group or organization. It is important to keep this in mind before you start ANY application process, or start working with new people.\nEven though I did not have a college degree, I still had an interest in developing coding skills. I understood early on in my application process that I was in control of my outcome. I assumed determination contained the key to my success, and soon found myself being referred to ProjectQUEST for financial assistance.I would have never known about ProjectQUEST if the Codeup staff had not offered this vital information. The dedication and support offered by these organizations helped me through the multiple application processes. If you plan to visit projectQUEST or Workforce Solutions to inquire about their grants, make sure you\u2019re determined to learn their language, and earn the money. If you have the right amount of determination you can find the proper channels fueling San Antonio\u2019s STEM ecosystem through a simple Google search. Determination is one of the common denominators all Codeup graduates share, and if you too share this similarity, check out the\u00a0scholarships\u00a0offered by Codeup.\nPeople want jobs, but not everyone wants to work.\n\nvia GIPHY\nCodeup\u2019s mission statement is the following, \u201cAt Codeup, we focus on two things: you and your success. Find a job within six months of graduation,\u00a0or get 50% of your tuition returned.\u201d Let me assure you they deliver in service, \u00a0content, and in career guidance. However, the staff cannot force you to either study the curriculum or develop programming skills for you. There are people that come ready to overcome adversity, then there are the few who expect to be fed morning tacos with a silver spoon. If you\u2019re seriously considering Codeup, you need to prepare yourself to manage the beautiful chaos of assignments, interviews, and presentations.\nMy high school soccer coach had a saying, \u201cDo you think Ronaldo is going to parachute from a helicopter and score for you?\u201d We never expected Ronaldo at our high school practices but that was our coach handing down some of his kind wisdom. He used this as a tactic to build the team up before the start of our shooting drills. Ronaldo is a world star player who plays at a professional level so what coach Ramos was really trying to say was, \u201cWork hard if you want the goal. Don\u2019t expect someone to come and score for you!\u201d You need to have a sense of responsibility before embarking on your own journey and launching your career.\nHave a servant\u2019s heart.\nSome lessons weren\u2019t coming from a screen or projector and I considered these some of my favorite lessons because they spoke more about human character. A perfect example is when the Codeup staff noticed a need in our community and decided to share their passion for service with all San Antonians. The office staff\u00a0volunteered to serve\u00a0at the San Antonio Food Bank. This was one of the unspoken teachings Codeup shared with me \u2013 these amazing individuals create an environment where you can grow in skill and as a human being. Kudos to them!\nI will iterate once again that Codeup will not force you to do something you don\u2019t want to do. As a newly placed member of this ecosystem and a Codeup graduate I would like to ask Codeup fellows and members of the community to ponder, \u201cHow are we contributing to the San Antonio ecosystem?\u201d Having the heart of a servant is something Codeup can\u2019t force you to do, but is a skill necessary to achieve self growth and development.\nDon\u2019t eat the tacos!\n\nvia GIPHY\nCodeup is geared to focus on your professional life, and not your waistline. The Codeup family loves to spoil the cohorts with food, they must know the way to a developer\u2019s heart. The morning tacos, the pizza, and snacks should be enough to lure you into the Vogue building. I loved every bite and sip of these delicious perks. However I do have to confess I gained a few pounds during my time at Codeup. I was also on a budget so the ramen noodle isle at the Walgreens became very familiar. Now that I look back I wish I only had one slice of pizza instead of my usual three.\nOne of the hardest parts of my Codeup journey was finding time to exercise. Taking care of myself felt impossible in this intense immersive environment, but believe me when I say \u201cIt is possible!\u201d This was thanks to one of my colleagues, who insisted on completing daily reps of stairs up and down the Travis Park garage.I felt instant restoration after just a few days of exercise. This simple exercise routine helped me deal with stress and gave me enough time to meditate on the things that pushed me towards triumph.\nDon\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you.\nThe saying \u201cDon\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you\u201d has stuck with me since I was thirteen years old, and made the dumb decision to complain about my job in front of my dad. My dad was not fond of me complaining of the man who signed my checks, so he shared a lesson behind his belligerent words. This made me realize that my ego was blocking my ability to humble myself, and that I needed to be thankful to the people that were trying to help me. His wise words taught me to stay loyal to those who become part of my upbringing.\nThis saying has stuck with me ever since, and I decided to mark it as a special lesson. A lesson I could only acquired through experience. I realize now the same goes with any organization or relationship that we hold, professional or non professional. We should be able to acknowledge where our loyalties stand, and if we are giving the proper amount of recognition to those who have helped us.\nThe Codeup staff did everything in their power to plug me into a bigger network of opportunities. Lastly, I was exposed to a network of genuinely loving, and caring people. These amazing benefits make me appreciate the\u00a0Codeup program\u00a0so much more. I walked in with the desire to learn computer programming. I am leaving with the ability and skills that say \u201cI am a software developer!\u201d\n"}, {"title": "The Message Behind Our Billboards - Codeup", "content": "\nYou may have seen Codeup\u2019s billboards around town featuring recent career transitioners.

Their curriculum is designed by experts and regional employers, the coursework is taught by the best instructors around, and they have a track record of successful graduates.\nSkills Fund\u00a0is focused on two things: you and your success. \u00a0Take what you\u2019ve heard about or experienced with student loans, and throw it out the window. Whether you\u2019ve proudly served our country and you\u2019re ready to enter the workforce, you\u2019re just starting your career, looking for a career switch, or upskilling, we\u2019re providing a return on education by only partnering with bootcamps and schools that provide impactful, proveable outcomes to their students.\n\u201cTuition is the number one concern that applicants have coming into Codeup, and having a trusted lending partner like Skills Fund to direct them to is extremely beneficial. \u00a0As an Admissions Manager, I am confident that Skills Fund is providing a great experience to our students and offering a great product to help them cover their tuition costs.\u201d\n-Mario, Codeup Admissions Manager\n\nWhat does this mean?\u00a0We\u2019ve partnered with Codeup to provide clear-cut, fully upfront, and transparent financing for tuition and living expenses. Eligible students may borrow up to $21,500 for tuition and $6,000 for cost of living.\nBut \u2013 a student loan?\u00a0We get it. Traditionally, loans have been confusing \u2013 and unnecessarily so. We\u2019re on a mission to be transparent, up-front, and honest about all the terms involved with our financing. We\u2019re the only lender that provides all details of your financing\u00a0before you even apply. Students may discover their rate (interest rate + general APR) and monthly repayment amount using our loan calculator on our partnership website.\nHow will I repay?\u00a0While you\u2019re attending Codeup and for two months of grace afterwards, you\u2019ll make low, interest-only payments towards your loan balance. After your grace period ends, you\u2019ll begin full repayments. We\u2019re betting on your future, so there should be no strings attached: you can pay your loan off at any time with no prepayment penalties.\nHow does it work?\u00a0The simple process takes just four steps.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve applied to Codeup, head to the\u00a0Skills Fund partnership website\u00a0to discover your terms, calculate your monthly repayment, and apply for a loan online in less than 10 minutes. Choose from a 3- or 5-year loan, and add on cost of living financing if needed.\nAt the end of the application, we\u2019ll let you know whether or not you\u2019ve been approved. If you\u2019re denied, you may be given the opportunity to add a cosigner.\nOn the second Wednesday after your program begins, your tuition financing is sent to the school and your cost of living is sent directly to you.\nYou\u2019ll start making payments one month after your loan is disbursed. You\u2019ll be provided with several options for making payments, including AutoPay.\n\nWhat if I have most of my tuition covered, and only need to borrow a small amount to attend?\u00a0With Skills Fund, you can borrow as little as $2,000 towards your tuition. You can calculate your monthly repayment online to understand what you would need to contribute to your financing per month.\nWhat if I have a low credit score?\u00a0Skills Fund believes in you and your future, and that is reflected in our underwriting. If you\u2019re credit denied, you may be eligible to apply again with a cosigner.\nTo learn more about Skills Fund financing for Codeup, visit our partnership website or email us at\u00a0CustomerTrust@Skills.Fund.\nLEARN MORE\n"}, {"title": "Women in Tech Scholarship Recipient: Amy - Codeup", "content": "\nOne thing that I can proudly say after this whole Codeup process is that I survived (and thrived) as an independent woman, although not without\u00a0serious help from others! \u00a0This is my opportunity to thank those who have helped, including Codeup for generously offering me their\u00a0Women in Tech Scholarship.\n\nBefore Codeup, I was working full-time in another industry with a low salary. \u00a0I lived alone and was paying for all my rent and bills on my own, with no partner or parents for financial support. \u00a0In my field at the time, I struggled for years seeking advancement and growth opportunities from an industry that did not seem to value my skill set.\nEven given that stressful mindset, the idea of forfeiting my only source of income for several months to attend Codeup was\u00a0extremely\u00a0scary. \u00a0To justify this, I spent a lot of time researching, including attending\u00a0Codeup sponsored events, and reaching out to Codeup alumni and friends in the tech industry for their opinion. \u00a0Still, with all the encouragement in the world, my objections were:\n\nWill employers hire me over a degreed Computer Science graduate?\nWill I be a \u201cgood\u201d coder?\nWill I be an attractive candidate to employers, with my non-tech background?\nHow long will it take me to get hired?\nWill this investment in Codeup be worth it?\nWill I run out of my savings and die penniless on the mean streets of San Antonio (severe and irrational anxiety speaking here!)\n\n\u00a0\nLet me just go ahead and assure you that everything worked out \u2013 very well, in fact! \u00a0I made the leap of faith and decided to join the Redwood cohort. Here is my first person to thank: a male friend of mine who has been a programmer for years, who strongly encouraged me that this was a great direction for me to take to secure fulfillment and my continued independence. \u00a0I struggled to find statistics on this, but I have heard many similar stories from women about the\u00a0men\u00a0in their lives (friends, family, boyfriends, husbands) who work in the tech industry and encouraged them to learn to code.\nOn the first day of class, I counted: 6 women out of 23 total students. \u00a0Not bad! Despite the fact that these women were of different ages, marital statuses, careers, and stages of life, we all quickly bonded. \u00a0Within the first few weeks, we even planned our own Girls Night Out at a bar across the street from campus (that the guys from our cohort crashed, and I don\u2019t think anyone was upset about that)! \u00a0We also all participated in Codeup\u2019s weekly women\u2019s lunches, with featured female speakers who were alumnae or from the tech industry. Throughout the entire 18 strenuous weeks, these women and I supported and checked in with each other. Luckily, everyone in our cohort did the same, no matter the gender. \u00a0Thank you for this, Redwood women and men!\n\u00a0\nTo make a long story short, I was hired as a full stack developer a month before my graduation, with a decent pay bump from my previous career, and am now working in my second job in the field (yet another pay bump!) where I feel personally valued on a daily basis. \u00a0All of this, less than a year since\u00a0starting\u00a0Codeup! \u00a0As my final thank you, I am extremely grateful to Codeup for awarding me their Women in Tech scholarship, because it significantly reduced the loan amount I needed to attend, helped relieve a little bit of the anxiety of paying for Codeup, gave me more incentive to attend, and confirmed that I indeed was\u00a0exactly\u00a0what Codeup and employers were looking for in students and coders.\nIf you\u2019re a woman who desires independence and self-fulfillment, Codeup is\u00a0worth it! \u00a0Make sure to apply to the scholarship during your admissions process and feel free to reach out to\u00a0me\u00a0or\u00a0other female alumnae\u00a0if you want to hear more about our experiences before, during, and after Codeup.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\nAmy is very proud to say she is currently the only female developer employee working on Whataburger\u2019s first ever online ordering platform. She has a Master\u2019s degree in Music Theory and keeps that knowledge fresh by analyzing music on the radio during her daily commute. Since learning to code, what she enjoys the most is mentoring new developers.\n"}, {"title": "Anxious About the Job Fair - Codeup", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope you\u2019ve got your resumes ready, because\u00a0Codeup\u2019s\u00a0bi-annual\u00a0Tech Job Fair\u00a0is coming back this Fall! For most people, this is an exciting event, full of opportunity and new beginnings. While for some, the words \u201cJob Fair\u201d provoke anxiety and a deep-seated fear of proper handshaking.\n\n(via GIPHY)\nTo help a few of you entry-level folks out there, I sat down with my boss Fred Tawil \u2013 President of\u00a0Swipetrack Solutions\u00a0\u2013 and asked him if he had some advice for anyone attending the Job Fair in September.\nInterview With the Boss\nHow did you get into tech?\nI taught myself how to program years and years ago. When I graduated as a political science major, I needed something to do. My dad owned bingo halls and he needed a player tracking system, so I figured okay, I\u2019ll make a player tracking system. I taught myself how to program, I built the kiosk and built the software to run the player tracking.\nAs someone who didn\u2019t formally study something like CS, what has been the most difficult thing about managing a bunch of programmers?\u00a0\nI don\u2019t know. Everybody has their own method of programming and development. It\u2019s that balancing act between getting something done quick and getting it done right. It\u2019s figuring out how much time we can spend making it reliable versus getting it deployed.\nThat\u2019s true. There\u2019s always something new coming out in this industry.\nYeah, it\u2019s always good to keep an eye out on what\u2019s coming up, that way you\u2019re not stuck when something gets depreciated or reaches its end-of-life.\nWhen you\u2019re hiring, do you typically read everyone\u2019s resumes?\nIt depends. We typically glance at them. I understand that a lot of Codeup grads weren\u2019t in tech and are trying to move into it. That\u2019s actually good for us, especially as a small company. We like to see previous work history so we can hire someone with multiple skills.\nBack when you were conducting the interviews yourself, what are some things that would make a candidate stand out to you?\nMost of the time when we\u2019re hiring, we get a lot of competent coders that come to see us, and we see lots and lots of resumes. But an important thing for us now is, will this person fit in with the environment and will they like working here? When it comes down to the interview, you can be a competent coder, but what we want to know is if you\u2019ll mesh with the group of people here and if you\u2019re someone we can work with day to day.\nHow important would you say it is for someone to have a personal website and to have recent commits on GitHub?\nI can tell you we looked at everyone\u2019s personal website if their resume looked good. GitHub accounts not so much, because a lot of the time when someone is coming from a coding bootcamp they\u2019re all the same. A lot of the websites also looked similar, but if there was a way that you set yours apart, we saw those and those were pretty interesting.\nFor us it\u2019s not so much what you did while you were at Codeup, it\u2019s what else you did. Show me that you really enjoy programming and that you do it in your free time, as opposed to just looking for a higher paycheck. Do you have any apps in the App store, or a web application you made? Did you actually spend time on your website? I can tell you we do look at the source code and make sure if we\u2019re hiring somebody that they didn\u2019t just use a theme they bought on the internet and are pretending they built it. It\u2019s very easy to tell.\nDo you have any advice for anyone who is nervous about going to their first Tech Job Fair?\u00a0\nIt might be different, but I think it\u2019s more laid-back. I would say to just relax. The three or four times we did it, we enjoyed talking to people and finding those whose personalities stood out. So be relaxed, enjoy it, and just talk.\nFrom Personal Experience\u00a0\u00a0\nI clearly remember attending my first\u00a0Tech Job Fair\u00a0back in 2017, only because I was extremely anxious every day leading up to the event. I would go to\u00a0Geekdom\u00a0after class and had late nights to make sure that my website and online profiles were ready to go. Once the day came and I got there, my first thought was to run back to the car.\n(Image: Tenor)\nThree Easy Steps\nWhether you\u2019re planning to attend the Tech Job Fair to find employment or to network, it\u2019s completely normal to be a little worried about it. So here\u2019s my advice:\n\nDo Your Research\n\nI can vouch for the importance of doing a little research before attending. Make sure to look at the list of companies who will be there and make a mental note of those that really interest you. You\u2019ll be better off and more prepared to ask all the right questions.\n\nIntroduce Yourself\n\nIf you\u2019re not quite sure how, \u201cHello, my name is\u2026\u201d goes a long way.\n\nFollow Up\n\nThis is the step that most people forget. If you find a place that you fall in love with, you need to follow up. Why wouldn\u2019t you? That would be like falling head over heels for someone on the first date and forgetting to call. There are plenty of fish in the sea and a simple email thanking them for their time could be the reason they remember your name.\nPro Tip:\u00a0If you\u2019re currently in Codeup, you can even invite them to\u00a0Demo Day\u00a0and have another shot at impressing them with your new skills.\n\nvia GIPHY\nBottom Line\nMost importantly,\u00a0STAY TRUE TO YOURSELF. Getting hired into a new company is a lot like entering a new relationship. Companies want to hire someone they can get along with everyday \u2013 someone who values their work and the company culture. Ultimately, you want to be hired by people who \u201cget\u201d you. It\u2019s usually easy to tell when someone is not being genuine, so avoid pretending to be someone you\u2019re not. Put yourself out there, smile and most of all, bring some hand-sanitizer because you\u2019re going to be shaking a lot of hands.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\nSophie studied music for a few years before diving into the world of web development. Now it\u2019s too late to go back because there are bugs that need fixing.\nHer husband is also a software developer, and their baby looks a lot like Pooh Bear.\nIn her free time she covers music, re-watches The Office and drinks more bubble tea than any person should.\nShe is serving in the Texas National Guard and currently trains at Aerial Horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Codeup Student Check In: Month 1 - Codeup", "content": "\nCodeup welcomed our newest cohort, the Wrangell cohort, on July 23. With the start of this cohort, we are launching a new blog series: the Codeup Student Check In. We\u2019ll interview a student over the course of the 4.5 months to see how things are progressing from first impressions all the way to graduation. Thus, welcome to the Codeup Student Check In: Month 1!\nWe took the time to sit down with our Wrangell student to see how they\u2019ve been doing so far!\nCodeup: How did you hear about Codeup? Why did you want to apply?\nWrangell Student: My first encounter with Codeup was during a drive downtown. I\u2019m glancing at billboards while I\u2019m driving and I see Codeup on one of the billboards. I remember thinking I wasn\u2019t fully satisfied with my position in life, and my future goals aligned with Codeup\u2019s mission. So I took a risk and applied.\nC: What was the application process like?\nS: The\u00a0application process\u00a0is very easy to understand. You apply directly on the website, and a member of the team reaches out to you. There are a few steps in the process itself, including an interview, a campus visit and a skills assessment.\nC: Tell us about any financing options/grants/scholarships you received. Did you owe anything out of pocket?\nS: I\u2019m very happy to report my expenses are fully covered by a few grants and scholarships. The City of San Antonio\u00a0Workforce Solutions\u00a0grant, the Alamo College Techworks grant, and the\u00a0Women\u2019s Scholarship\u00a0all helped to cover the cost so that I paid nothing out of pocket.\nC: Describe a typical day for you from start to finish\nS: We start off with announcements and then what we call \u201cpush-ups,\u201d which are morning exercises to practice our chops. Sometimes we work on yesterday\u2019s assignment, or we \u00a0jump straight into lecture. After lecture we practice the material with an exercise. Then we have a lunch break. After lunch we come back and listen to afternoon announcements. We have lecture time again, followed by another exercise.\nC: Describe what you\u2019re learning right now. Is it hard/fun/challenging?\nS: Right now we are learning how to interact with the Google Maps API. This is probably the most challenging thing we\u2019ve gone over so far. It\u2019s very different extracting and working with code that is not your own. It feels like learning coding conventions all over again. But it\u2019s still a lot of fun!\nC: How has the learning process/information gathering been?\nS: The learning process has been amazing. We use the Codeup curriculum website in combination with other resources, such as developer websites, and program documentation.\nC: What has been the most memorable part of this month?\nS: It is empowering seeing a project idea go from a blank slate to \u00a0a full functioning program. The most memorable part of this month was the first time I ran a program and saw all the colors and components jump out at me on the screen.\nC: How do you feel your skill level compares to when you started?\nS: My skill level has definitely increased compared to where I was initially. I think one of the most valuable things I\u2019ve been taught are the tools that developers use on a daily basis such as\u00a0Github, git, Node, the IntelliJ IDE and more.\nC: How have the instructors been helpful?\nS: The instructors are very receptive to feedback. They recognize that their students are extremely diverse with different skill levels, and respond in an understanding manner. They also encourage us to work hard for a problem answer, rather than just giving it to us outright.\nC:\u00a0 Can you share a fun experience you have had this month?\nS: It is so much fun talking to my classmates and realizing how kind and open they are. I initially wanted to be alone on my lunch break, but then I had so much fun eating lunch with my classmates! I feel that Codeup is even helping me overcome my shy nature, and feeling the change within myself is fun and enlightening.\n"}, {"title": "Announcing Our New Minorities in Tech Scholarship - Codeup", "content": "\n\n\n\n\nBy Kyra Seegmiller\nWe have exciting news!

Alvarez II\nThere is so much more than meets the eye when meeting Cayden Simler, Digiboost\u2019s newest developer. The Codeup graduate has set a new standard at Digiboost, by not only meeting expectations but exceeding them with his passion for technological innovation. From humble beginnings as a military child, moving from place to place, to building a life in San Antonio, Texas, Cayden is a one of a kind talent, displaying a multitude of skills ranging from CSS, JavaScript, PHP and troubleshooting methods for solving developmental problems. At Digiboost, Cayden hopes to empower and enable small business to thrive in a corporate world with his distinct style and approach to coding. \n\u201cI want to be a part of building up the Digiboost brand while also building up the small businesses that come to us for support,\u201d Simler said. \u201cI really want to contribute and give back in the best way I know how.\u201d\nAfter acquiring a taste for web development in high school, Cayden looked to Codeup as an alternative to obtaining a four-year degree. Codeup provided Cayden with a program focused on developing the skills required for his role as a web developer. Codeup\u2019s hands-on approach to coding proved to be helpful to Cayden, allowing him to immediately put to practice everything he was learning. In just 16 weeks, Cayden was certified in Full-Stack Development, dubbed the status of Junior Software Developer, and matched up with one of Codeup\u2019s employer partners. The Codeup program is dedicated to providing its students with the skills necessary to effectively land an entry level coding position and launch their career in software development. \n\u201cCodeup was designed exactly the way I needed it to be,\u201d Simler said. \u201cI gained the ability to problem solve, debug and learn new coding languages quickly. I \u00a0learned methods through whatever means necessary and created a fast entry into a career as a developer with the skills I needed to succeed.\u201d\nSince starting at Digiboost, the team has been beyond impressed by the level of commitment and efficiency Cayden has brought to the company. His developmental knowledge has brought him to become one of Digiboost\u2019s lead developers.\n\u201cCayden is a true asset to Digiboost,\u201d Brian Campbell, Digiboost Client Care Specialist, said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard much about Codeup or the types of skills they taught, but Cayden is quite versed in several different coding forms. He has proven to be a great resource, either with live customers or with employees in the office. In the future, I can see Cayden moving into a senior type role very fast. But I believe his skill set is something we need and want him to get more advanced in.\u201d\nCayden\u2019s display of talent and proficiency have proved to be the type of personality sought out by Digiboost. His pursuit of excellence within his field has proven to be quite the journey, one that has earned the admiration of his team and colleagues. Surely, looking to the future, Cayden is bound to leave a lasting impact at Digiboost while growing and utilizing his incredible talents. \n\u201cI\u2019m very excited for the future of tech in San Antonio and Codeup\u2019s role in the tech district.

But within the tech industry, it\u2019s even more tricky\u2014you want candidates with sharp skills and competitive experience, but also those who can make room to grow and adapt to new changes. The methods you use to recruit will directly influence who you attract, so you\u2019ll need to get innovative with your strategies if you want the best. Here are the top innovative measures being used in recruiting for the tech industry today.\nAssessing Coding Skills\nA candidate with formal coding education is a must. A candidate with years of workplace experience is even better. But neither will necessarily guarantee you\u2019re getting the best developer or programmer possible. That\u2019s where coding assessments come in. This skill-based method makes the recruitment easier by relying on hard data, which reduces unnecessary decision making and possible bias. It\u2019s the closest you\u2019ll get to knowing exactly how capable a candidate is, and exactly how they\u2019ll perform, logistically speaking, for your business.\nChatbot Interviews\nThe interview process can be timely and even expensive, especially if you\u2019re hoping to attract global or out-of-town candidates. Whether you use it for the interview itself or just the pre-screening process, a virtual session makes more efficient use of the selection process, both in time, money, and convenience. Try Google Hangouts or Skype for a free method, or check out a software review site for the best video interview software available.\nMore Efficient Applicant Tracking\nThese systems are known for being cumbersome and, ironically, even inefficient because they\u2019re so often hard to use or even used incorrectly. The good news is that these systems are simplifying their programs with the help of AI and rebranding themselves as \u201ccandidate relationship management software\u201d. Employers can now count on these programs to correctly track all potentials without error, as well as recommend new qualified candidates.\nA New Way of Interviewing\nThe standard \u201cWhere do you see yourself in five years?\u201d question-and-answer interviews aren\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but they probably won\u2019t land you any innovative hires. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve begun to fall by the wayside, especially in the tech world.\nWhile the core questions are still important, tech companies are now rebranding their strategies to shake things up a bit and make room for assessing soft skills and personality\u2014the areas in which traditional interviews fall short.\nFor example, the NFL susses out potential candidates by using Wonderlic, an online personality test that assesses emotional intelligence, determination, and overall demeanor.\u00a0 Companies are also ditching conformity by trying out unconventional meeting places like a coffee shop or cafe. It\u2019s all about getting to know a candidate better in a more dimensional way, and these new tools and methods are a way to get to know a truer sense of a person overall.\nAnd what about helping out with the time-consuming task of recruiting? Here are some of TrustRadius\u2019s Top Rated recruiting software for 2018, which help streamline the recruitment process of searching for, attracting, interviewing, and onboarding new personnel.\nOracle HCM Cloud\nTrustRadius Score: 7.7 out of 10\nBest suited for large companies with many employees, a considerable budget, and complex needs.

But, what happens when the Job Fair doors close?\nHere at Codeup, we\u2019re passionate about bridging the gap between talent and demand, so we\u2019ve outlined helpful tips to ensure you continue bringing your A-game and leave a lasting impression!\n1)\u00a0Make meaningful connections with employers on LinkedIn\nDon\u2019t let yourself become someone they barely remember. Find the recruiters on LinkedIn and connect with them.\nAdd a personal note as to why you want to connect with them. Consider recapping conversations you had at the job fair and reiterating what position(s) in which you were interested. Don\u2019t blindly connect \u2013 remind them of who you are!\n2) Social Media\nUse social media to your advantage! Companies are more connected than ever before, so what better way to show you\u2019re interested than by following them on social media? Some key ones include LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and possibly even Instagram. But, WHY social media? You\u2019ll be constantly in the loop of what the companies are up to and what they\u2019re in the business of doing. As a result, you stay relevant.\n3) Set up alerts\nIn the advent of social media, apps are also on the rise. Set up alerts through your favorite job sites \u2013 almost all of which have apps.\nHere\u2019s a few that our Director of Employer Partnerships recommend:\n\nLinkedIn and the LinkedIn Jobs app (iOS)\u00a0and (Android)\nIndeed\nGlassdoor\nDice\n\n4) Double check your resume\nDo you have two resum\u00e9s? It\u2019s best to have two \u2013 one that is tailored for the role you want and one tailored to recruiters. Hand out the latter one to recruiters or at job fairs. It should also highlight the well roundedness of who you are!\n5) How\u2019s your cover letter?\nStep one: do you have a cover letter? Step two: is it one that can be tailored with minimal effort? While most companies nowadays don\u2019t require a mandatory cover letter, it\u2019s good to have one on file. This link has great tips on\u00a0prepping one.\n6) Recruiters can be your friend (in the professional sense)\nA good recruiter won\u2019t view working with you as a transaction. Working with a recruiter allows you to a) outsource a significant portion of the job search while also gaining a direct connection to a professional network b) give you access to a transparent job search process (such as company culture and interviewer style). In addition, it\u2019s in a recruiter\u2019s best interest to stay in touch with you once you accept an offer to make sure you\u2019re adjusting. You\u2019re not a transaction \u2013 you\u2019re an investment. When they see you continue to succeed, it allows them to stay at the top of your mind as you continue your professional path.\n7) Show that you\u2019re available\nDoes your LinkedIn reflect that you\u2019re wanting to hear from recruiters? This is an often overlooked step, but is key when actively job searching.\nOther (little) things that make a (BIG) Difference\n\nFunctional email address\n\nHave a functional\u00a0GMAIL\u00a0address. Why Gmail? It\u2019s encrypted in transit and at rest. These emails are typically embraced by HR and recruiting managers\nIf you have an email ending in .edu, that\u2019s okay!\nIn addition, a naming conversation is encouraged, like \u201cfirst.last,\u201d \u2018last.first,\u201d anything that incorporates your names and not personally identifying information (i.e. birthdays, SSN)\n\n\nSet up an outgoing voicemail, so recruiters aren\u2019t totally detracted from the message. It helps convey a soft skill by hearing a voice\n\nWe know robo calls are the worst. But, it\u2019s best to answer your phone from unknown numbers while job searching \u2013 especially if it\u2019s a local number to the job market where you\u2019re searching. It could be a recruiter or a hiring manager who\u2019s interested in you in that very moment, and may pass you up for the next person that picks up the phone.\n\n\n\nThe next Tech Job Fair is scheduled for September 2018. Until then, we wish you all the best of luck as you continue navigating through the job search!\n"}, {"title": "10 Tips to Crush It at the SA Tech Job Fair - Codeup", "content": "\n10 Tips to Crush It at the SA Tech Job Fair\nSA Tech Job Fair\nThe third bi-annual San Antonio Tech Job Fair is just around the corner. Over 25 companies will be at The Jack Guenther Pavilion\u00a0on April 10th, and they are hungry for new tech team members!\nAt the job fair, companies want to quickly source a list of new talent leads. AKA they need to find qualified employees they can begin interviewing for jobs. Recruiters will represent their organization at tables with informational handouts and company swag. Your goal at a job fair is to set yourself apart from other candidates and ensure your name makes it to the top of those lead lists.\nThink of your interaction with the company as a mini screening interview. The company rep will subtly evaluate basic qualities like your professionalism, communication and interpersonal skills, work experience, and interest level in the organization. Job fairs are also an opportunity for you to gain information about companies that may not be easily accessible online. \u00a0\nAt Codeup, we\u2019re passionate about bridging the gap between talent and demand, so we\u2019ve outlined 10 tips to ensure you bring your A-game and leave a lasting impression!\n10 Tips for Totally Crushing it at the SA Tech Job Fair\n\nUse keywords to describe your skills, but don\u2019t go overboard. You\u2019ll probably be talking to a recruiter or talent acquisition specialist. As a technical candidate, recognize these individuals usually aren\u2019t developers or network administrators. They know terms like \u201cJavaScript\u201d and \u201cApache,\u201d but haven\u2019t written a line of code or spun up a server, so don\u2019t get too caught up in industry jargon.\nResearch the companies ahead of time. Review the list of attending companies and make sure you know what the company does and whether or not they hire people in your desired role. Look up recent news on the company and mention it during your conversation.\nDefine your own goals for the job fair. Are you searching for a specific type of role or company culture? What matters most in your job search? Are there companies you want to prioritize? \u00a0Develop a game plan and be intentional with your time.\nPrepare a stellar r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Bring about 20 copies of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to the event, printed on nice paper. We won\u2019t cover resume writing in this post, but there are a plethora of online resources you can consult. For job fairs, don\u2019t worry about cover letters.\nPolish your online profiles. If recruiters have a copy of your resume, you can be sure they will stalk you online soon. Make sure your online presence is professional and appropriate. A good place to start is by Googling yourself. Update your LinkedIn, and clean up any social media profiles.\nCraft a 30-60 second elevator pitch. You may only have a few minutes with an employer. What will you say if they ask, \u201cTell me about yourself?\u201d Consider structuring your pitch like this: Who you are + What you do + What your goals are + Why that matters to the company.\nDon\u2019t show up in a t-shirt, but trade in your suit for something more chill. Always keep it professional, but remember: tech is typically more casual than other industries. You\u2019ll likely feel out of place if you look like you belong on Wall St., so refer to this guide on dressing for tech interviews.\nDon\u2019t forget the basics. Start and end each conversation with a firm handshake. Make eye contact while conversing. Smile! Thank the recruiter before you move on to the next table.\nAsk educated questions. Don\u2019t waste valuable face time with recruiters by asking questions like, \u201cWhat does [Insert Company here] do?\u201d They hate that question! Instead, try some of these:\n\nWhat are the top 3-5 examples of knowledge, skills, and abilities you look for in candidates?\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you have for someone who wants to work here?\nWhat is your interview process like?\nAre you hiring for any roles not currently listed on your websites?\n\n\nFollow up. Collect business cards from each table. The next day, send a short note expressing your interest in the company\u2019s opportunities and thanking the recruiter for his or her time.\n\nRSVP for the SA Tech Job Fair taking place at the Jack Guenther Pavilion \u2013 September 18th starting at 4 pm.\u00a0\n"}, {"title": "5 Hiring Trends in Software Development - Codeup", "content": "\n5 Hiring Trends in Software Development\n\u00a0\nCompanies (and ideal candidates) care about solving problems for the end user.\nHiring needs in the tech industry \u2013 specifically on software development teams \u2013 evolve almost as quickly as the technologies themselves. One year employers are trying to get their hands on Ruby developers, and 12 months later, a new JavaScript framework is all the buzz. This doesn\u2019t make things easy for job seekers or new employers looking to hire their first software developers.\nDrawing on conversations with our 200+ employer partners at Codeup, we\u2019ve compiled a shortlist of five trends we\u2019ve seen emerge recently. In a nutshell, it\u2019s all about solving problems for the end user.\nThe growing popularity of Agile has created more opportunities for full-stack developers.\nFirst, what is Agile? In a nutshell, it\u2019s a set of management practices that allows software developers to write code and build products more efficiently.\nAgile has gained serious ground in IT departments across a variety of industries, from finance to food service. While Agile doesn\u2019t explicitly require a team of full-stack developers, it does ask developers to be fully engaged in all facets of building an application, from creating user stories to deployment. As a result, roles on an Agile team start to blur, and each individual winds up working on features across the tech stack.=\nThere\u2019s no doubt that a team of specialized front-end and back-end developers can build great software. However, today\u2019s hiring managers seem to have a preference for full-stack developers, or at least those who understand both sides of a given tech stack, because these well-rounded employees have a leg up on others in an Agile environment.\nGood software development leverages design thinking across the stack to benefit the end user.\nStructure and efficiency are still important for software engineers to get right, but more and more, it\u2019s critical for developers to code across the stack with the end user at top of mind. In fact, Agile teams dedicate time to create user stories that inform the products they build, and each team member is involved in a recurring (or iterative) design process.\nTim Brown, the CEO of international design firm IDEO, says, \u201cDesign thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer\u2019s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.\u201d\nSoftware is everywhere these days, and it\u2019s not just for techies. Solutions need to be slick, innovative, and easy-to-use. The latest version of iOS or Android needs to be impressive enough for tech enthusiasts to get excited about and straightforward enough for grandpa to check his voicemail. Most importantly, good developers realize those two things aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.\nJavaScript takes candidates further than ever before.\nNow more than ever, a strong understanding of JavaScript can really help software developers land a great job.\nOnce a fairly basic, client-side scripting language, JavaScript has made powerful gains in functionality while staying lean and efficient. In recent years, Node.js, a server-side runtime, has transformed JavaScript into a full-stack powerhouse.\nJavaScript continues to deliver on the front-end, too: React.js has revolutionized user interface development and has become the front-end JavaScript framework of choice for Fortune 500 companies and startups alike.\nDiverse and non-traditional candidates are in the spotlight.\nDiversity in tech remains elusive and persists as a key talking point in the industry. Women, as well as black, Latinx, and LGBT workers, remain severely underrepresented. In light of this year\u2019s high-profile headlines on gender diversity issues at Uber and Google, many tech companies have doubled down on their commitments to boost workplace equality and employ people who authentically empathize with a diverse group of end users.\nWe\u2019ve also noticed a growing trend toward diversity initiatives that aim to include nontraditional hires like military veterans, career changers, and candidates without four-year degrees. For example, the Microsoft LEAP initiative seeks candidates who have tech experience but may have been out of work for a while (e.g., stay-at-home moms or dads) or career changers with at least six months of software development experience.\nStrong problem-solving skills remain the common denominator among great developers, and interviewers know it.\nThis is less of a hiring trend than it is a skill that employers continue to require of all new developers, especially non-traditional hires who may not have a computer science degree or years of experience.\nSoftware developers \u2013 especially those new to the field \u2013 are in a constant state of learning new technologies and solving problems they\u2019ve never encountered before. The ability to define a problem, recognize key inputs, and identify potential solutions is particularly important when the quality of a line of code depends on the developer\u2019s ability to think logically and efficiently.\nInterviewers often ask candidates to walk through a scenario, usually a past experience or a hypothetical case study, where the candidate needs to demonstrate their ability to assess a problem and formulate a solution. Sometimes these questions can be technical and quantitative, other times they\u2019re more behavioral, but either way, it\u2019s clear that companies want employees who think well on their feet and come to their managers with solutions instead of self-explanatory questions.\nConclusion: Honing your skills to meet employment trends can help you get a software development job, but first, invest in learning the fundamentals of programming.\nBeyond these trends, employers continue to look for one thing above all else: technical skills! Before learning a new JavaScript framework and doing research on best practices for design thinking, you\u2019ve got to have the fundamentals of software development under your belt. That\u2019s where Codeup comes in. Our 18-week career accelerator gives you all the tools and training you need to capitalize on these trends and land a great job as a software developer.\nTo learn more about Codeup, email us at info@codeup.com or apply today!\n\u00a0\n"}, {"title": "What Makes a Successful Software Developer? - Codeup", "content": "\nWhat Makes a Successful Software Developer?\n\u00a0\n4 questions to ask yourself when considering a career as a Software Developer.\nWritten by Dimitri Antoniou\nSoftware developers build the programs, games, and apps that run on your computer, cell-phone, tablet, video-game system or e-reader. A software developer can be front-end, back-end or full-stack.\nSuccessful software developers come from diverse backgrounds and a variety of industries. Here at Codeup, our job is to advance existing careers and launch new ones. That means we\u2019ve seen it all. We\u2019ve learned that being a successful software developer comes from the right combination of personality traits and technical knowledge. We\u2019ve gathered a few questions to ask yourself if you are considering becoming a software developer.\n#1: Do I like working with computers?\nYou will spend your time building, improving and maintaining different types of software across different pieces of technology. This means that working with computers, phones & tablets should be something you enjoy. This might sound obvious, but it\u2019s huge! We often meet students who are attracted to tech because of exciting new products, collaborative work environments, and flexible schedules. These are all awesome perks, but remember that the most important piece of your work will be the code itself. A software developer spends the majority of their time fixing problems and building frameworks.\n#2: Do I love to learn?\nTechnology is a constantly evolving industry. While one language is hot today, it might die tomorrow. Our co-founder, Jason Straughan, often reminisces about writing an entire book on a language that disappeared from use by the time the book was published. What does that mean for you? You should love the process of learning new skills and keeping up to date with cutting-edge technologies. A career in technology gives you the opportunity to reinvent yourself many times. You may love working with databases today and find that UI/UX is where your strengths are in a year. You will need to be able to adapt to changes in the industry and be willing to learn on the job or put in the hours on your own time. The more programming languages under your belt the more value you will be able to provide during every stage of your career.\n#3: Am I gritty?\nGrit is a character trait that can make or break long-term success. Psychologist Angela Duckworth explains it as, \u201cPassion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina\u2026sticking with your future, day in and day out.\u201d When it comes to software development, having grit means learning from your failures. We\u2019ve seen students struggle not because they can\u2019t figure out the content, but because they are afraid of failing. Move past that fear! You will inevitably make mistakes, but our successful students are those that learn from their failure along the way.\n#4: Am I a problem-solver?\nAt the end of the day, code is designed to solve a problem! Your ability to think logically, brainstorm creative solutions, proactively research answers, and fill gaps will make you an effective and efficient software developer. That\u2019s why we test for problem-solving ability in our admissions process. Do you like tinkering, Googling, fixing, solving puzzles, and finding your own answers? If you do, you may appreciate the challenges that come along with developing software and debugging code.\nThese are the questions to ask yourself when making the decision to become a software developer. If you answered yes to these questions, coding could be for you. At Codeup we offer an 18-week career accelerator that will help you get a foot in the industry. Ready to start?

Here, they share their highs, their lows, their experience and their best tips for succeeding during and after the program.\nPlease give a little introduction about yourself.\nStefanie: I\u2019m originally from California. I grew up in the Silicon Valley before the days of Google and had a pretty decent handle on free internet via AOL Trial discs, Napster torrenting, and multi-player gaming platforms (before they were cool). Given the mid to late 90\u2019s, I had quite a bit of backlash within the online communities for my gender and my age. I gave up on tech during my early college years when a female professor told me, \u201cthere no room for women in the booming tech industry.\u201d I quickly turned to music and language arts and found myself pursuing the long-term degree before leaving for Texas to enter a Japanese Studies program. I had a rude awakening and poor experience when most jobs I was offered were non-technical, non-creative, and extremely repetitive. It wasn\u2019t going to work. My grandfather had always been a firm believer that I was meant for tech, engineering and developing new ideas. After chatting with him about my failed attempts and unhappiness, I decided to give tech another try through coding and entered into the Codeup family. I worked full-time while attending a night class and found myself doubting my abilities from the beginning. During our first project, something clicked and with the help of the instructors, I had a new-found love for problem solving, developing and code. I haven\u2019t turned back since.\nLorne:\u00a0I\u2019m also from California. \u00a0I hail from Oakland. \u00a0I\u2019m into just about everything. \u00a0I have worked as a high school basketball coach, personal chef, bartender, bouncer, opera singer, paralegal/legal assistant, and dance instructor. \u00a0I love movies and books\u2026.I read about 40+ a year. \u00a0I\u2019m into fantasy and sci-fi, but also enjoy reading Deepak Chopra and books about travelogues (which is somewhat funny because I\u2019m terrified of traveling). I\u2019m a hippie, jock, musician, and nerd. I love people and connection and for someone who grew up largely an only child, I\u2019m always out creating new family. \u00a0If something interests me, I pursue it. \u00a0I like to dive into things that I can share with others. \u00a0I\u2019m an avid NBA fan (Go Warriors!) and if you ever want to argue about basketball, I\u2019m game. \u00a0If you want to see me fully free and in my element, put me around music and dancing. Programming puts me back in my Lego days, where I get to be creative and build things. It\u2019s my new adventure. \n\nCan you describe your career path and how you got to where you are now? Were you always interested in programming?\nStefanie: I wasn\u2019t always interested in programming. I had always seen programming as a career that leads to a dark room with smelly individuals, Cheetos and Mountain Dew. I didn\u2019t want to be placed in a cubical and made to work 10 \u2013 16 hour days to complete a project or operating system. Web development when I first set out to learn tech was not a major degree option or talked about much. Browsers were faulty and new to the scene. It was a questionable career path at the time. My grandfather was an engineer with Stanford University and always brought home hardware for PCs. I thought that would be my path as well. I loved building and problem solving the communication errors between parts. Little did I know that programming was that too on a more abstract and dynamic level.\nLorne: I absolutely thought programming was way out of my range and my experience. \u00a0Nothing about it felt like something I would be into. \u00a0I had simply grown out of my old position and location. \u00a0I was a paralegal in San Francisco and I was no longer challenged. \u00a0I wanted to go back to school or do something new but had no clue what. \u00a0It was too expensive to do there, my parents brought up Codeup (they live here), and here I am. \n\nWhy did you look into an immersive program? Why the Codeup experience?\nStefanie:\u00a0Honestly, I was extremely doubtful of the program, especially after being trained into the thought process that traditional college was the only form of useful education and the only experience one should seek before career searching. It wasn\u2019t until I was trying to break into marketing firms, coding communities and design groups that I was told about the program. Three people approached me and recommended the program. I didn\u2019t listen. Then life started shouting it at me. I saw the billboard\u2026 then a marketing card in the mail\u2026 and then I heard a friend talking about their acceptance into the program. Finally I gave in and went to the Codeup location.I took a couple of tests and passed with flying colors. I decided to take the leap since they were offering a night program that started after work hours. Since they helped with job placement as well, I took them to be my chance at a better work life.\nLorne: I was on the verge of going to teach English in Turkey when my parents suggested that I look at Codeup. \u00a0I took the test, not sure if I\u2019d get in, and then when I did, I bought a ticket the next day and the rest is history. \nWhat was your experience with Codeup?\nStefanie: Overall, my experience was eye-opening. I did not expect to have young mothers, grandmothers, high school graduates or college graduates with Masters in the same class. The culture was liberating since we were all there for the same reason \u2013 to change our paths and achieve new goals. The instructors were very hands on and helped everyone thinking about problem-solving in new ways and how to attempt developing ideas out of nothing. The hardest step was always deciding where to start and finding the confidence to dive in, code first, and prepare to work through your own problems and use the resources available. \nLorne: Codeup opened my eyes to a new world. \u00a0They made programming and something that seemed so daunting, really fun. \u00a0I never thought I would enjoy it, but the collaborative nature of it and the creative juices that got to come out, made me fall in love with it. \u00a0The instructors, the classroom, everything about it made me feel like I could do it. \u00a0I think that was the largest thing. \u00a0Despite any difficulties or frustrating, I felt empowered\u2026like given time and community, I could solve anything. \u00a0That\u2019s an awesome feeling. \nHow do you feel Codeup has helped/is helping you grow? Did/How has Codeup\u2019s career services helped you?\nStefanie: The program taught me independence and confidence. I am more free-thinking than I have ever been. I understand how to think about everyday issues from multiple viewpoints, and I know how to stand my ground and prove my points and way of thinking. I know that it\u2019s okay to be wrong and how to go about admitting it. Even if it seems counterproductive to building independence, I know it\u2019s okay to ask for help.The program also taught me about resourcefulness and communication on a whole new level. These two features alone were enough to land me just about any job. Soft skills are just as important as the hard skills. \nLorne: It taught me how to break down problems. \u00a0It taught me how to ask for help and that is perfectly right and ok. Codeup gave me my first job, and kind of my second, as I worked for one of the founders as my second. \u00a0They always believe in their students and help them match and grow. \n\nAny advice for current and future Codeup Alumni?\nStefanie: Understand that this program is meant to accelerate your learning of development. You have to be hungry for this knowledge and supplement the curriculum outside of the classroom as well as practicing it. There has to be a drive for the goal ahead. Be willing to sacrifice some of your free time.This class is so much more rewarding if you learn to work as a class unit early on and help each other succeed. Employers will see it in your example work, the projects and want to hear about your ability to communicate and mesh well as a developer. Be open-minded and be willing to be wrong. I learned so much more from being wrong than from being right. Experience is priceless in the long run.\u00a0\nLorne: Stay patient and humble. \u00a0This world of programming is huge. \u00a0It can be overwhelming. \u00a0Just keep that learner mind and understand that time and keyboard time are your greatest assets. \u00a0\u00a0It may not feel like you\u2019re growing, but then you\u2019ll look up every now and then and realize just how much you know and how far you\u2019ve come. \u00a0It\u2019s a pretty awesome feeling. \nWhat was the best part of the experience in your opinion?\nStefanie:\u00a0The staff and fellow classmates made the program great in my eyes. The interactions and experiences of having a new community of people who had similar goals made for a welcoming and productive environment.\nLorne: I think the greatest part is the classroom. \u00a0The idea that when everyone shares knowledge, everyone succeeds. \u00a0The collaborative power of coding is insane and if there\u2019s anything I can attribute to the rapid rise of technology is that it brought a collective human mind to any problem. \u00a0People from all over the world now have the ability to work together to create brand new things. \u00a0You get your first taste of that in the classroom. \u00a0The sense that everyone wants you to succeed and you can lean on one another to fill in gaps where you may not be the strongest. \u00a0It\u2019s a really amazing feeling.\n"}, {"title": "Alumni Spotlight: Mary-Kaitlin (MK) Warren - Codeup", "content": "\nAlumni Spotlight: Mary-Kaitlin (MK) Warren\nFrom being an Assistant Manager at Entreprise Rent-A-Car to becoming a stellar programmer, MK shares her path that led her to where she is now\u2014a student in the Microsoft LEAP program.\nCan you describe your career story and how you got to where you are right now?\n Random. My senior year of high school, I started watching Bones and first heard of Anthropology. So I majored in Anthropology. I also majored in German, because I wanted a back up plan in case I decided not to go to grad school for Anthropology, and everybody knows that companies are fighting over German majors. The spring semester of my senior year, I had no plan and my family told me that I needed to get a job, so I hit up Monster and applied to Enterprise\u2019s Management Training program. Randomly, I got the job. After 2 years I decided I didn\u2019t want to do that for the rest of my life. I got on Monster (I should send them a card) and randomly found Codeup. I think it was an ad? Pretty sure I didn\u2019t know what a bootcamp was at the time. After that, it gets less random and more Codeup driven. My first job after Codeup was with a company that had come to my Demo Day. The job after that was with a company that came to do onsite interviews at Codeup. I found out about my current opportunity through Codeup as well. So\u2026 three cheers (or jobs) for Codeup!\nHow do you think your past has brought you here to Codeup?\n I had taken a computer science class in high school and done well. When I was looking to transition out of the customer service/sales realm, I knew that I wanted a set of hard skills, and luckily Codeup offered a place to grow those.\nThere are a lot of options out there for learning to code. Why Codeup?\u00a0\n I thought about trying to do something online, like CodeAcademy, but I ended up going with Codeup because of the connections. Where as DIYing your coding education is possible, it\u2019s hard to get your resume through the door if you have no professional experience. Codeup helped make initial connections that have propelled me into the career that I want. Also, I am terrible at making myself watch videos online.\nWhat got you hooked on programming or the idea of moving into the tech space?\n I am drawn to programming because there is an answer. If your code doesn\u2019t compile, there is a reason (and probably a silly one at that). It was a nice change of pace coming from a liberal arts background, where things are a little less black and white.\nWhat are some things you like about Codeup?\u00a0\n Definitely the snacks.\nWhat would you change/want to see us do differently?\n It\u2019s hard for a coding school to do this, because it is a business, but a little more clarity upfront about the types of positions to expect (especially in a market like San Antonio), would have been nice. Part of the reason why I decided to do Codeup was the claim that graduates made 15k more afterwards, and so I took out the loan for 15k with the idea that I could pay it back in less than a year. A month in, I realized that the average graduate salary was about 15k less than I was making, so that was a little disappointing and cause some numbers shuffling. Again, I know that\u2019s kind of a hard thing to change, but it\u2019s the only suggestion that I have. Everything else was pretty good.\nWhat are your plans after Codeup, both in the immediate and long term?\nWell, speaking in hindsight, short term was to get paid to program and get some experience on my resume. Long term is to move into a tech arch role, change the world with some awesome software and/or hardware, and become Tony Stark.\nA lot of people don\u2019t think of SA as being a vibrant city for Society of Women Engineers (SWE). What have you seen in terms of the city, people, events, etc. that contradict this idea?\u00a0\nWe\u2019re on the comeup.\n\u00a0I would say that San Antonio has a lot of companies that have very robust SWE communities that exist outside of the Downtown/Houston street epicenter. I think that because of the geography of San Antonio (read: sprawl), it is harder to see than a place like Austin or Seattle.\nWhat are some of the things minorities, disenfranchised and marginalized groups need to know about the support, or lack thereof, within Codeup?\n Codeup is there to support you. Practically speaking, their success is your success. Aside from that, everyone there is super supportive and just generally nice. If you aren\u2019t understanding a topic, the instructors are willing to help and walk you through it (even on their lunch break. WOW!!!).\nWhat would you say to these groups of people who are on the fence about joining a bootcamp due to lack of diversity, inclusivity, and overall fear of not having the support that they would need?\n This is a bit tricky. I would say that first and foremost, know you\u2019re own truth. Software isn\u2019t for everyone, so have that moment of honesty where you decide if you are doing this because you like the idea of programming every day, or because you like the idea of a 6 figure salary in 4 months and working from home everyday (spoiler alert: highly unlikely for your first, or dare I say, second programming job). If you are passionate about building software for the rest of your life, I honestly believe that Codeup is the best place to start that journey. The community is incredible; the instructors are amazeballs; the staff is incredibly supportive; and the founders are boss *** hustlers. It truly is the best place to start your development journey in San Antonio. (P.S. if you are from out of town, forget Codeup. Come to San Antonio for the breakfast tacos, and stay for Codeup.)\nHow\u2019d you find out about the LEAP program and what are some of the reasons for wanting to participate?\n Dylan sent out an email with some information about the program, and it seemed like an awesome opportunity. If you don\u2019t major in CS, there aren\u2019t a lot of opportunities to \u201cintern\u201d for the Microsofts/Googles/Facebooks of the world. LEAP is awesome, because it gives you that same foot in the door that an internship gives, even if you didn\u2019t go the traditional Computer Science route. (Also: Seattle weather, multitude of hiking trails, coffee).\nLEAP is an incredible opportunity! What are you planning on doing after completing the program?\n Keep learning. Become Tony Stark.\nAnything else you would like to talk about regarding the Career Services and Development through Codeup?\n c:\\myPath. In other words, Codeup\u2019s Career Services and Development has gotten me 3/3 gigs. That goes to show that just because you get your first job, doesn\u2019t mean that you are out of the family.\n"}, {"title": "Competitor Bootcamps Are Closing.

Is the Model in Danger?\n\u00a0\n\nIs the programming bootcamp model in danger?\nIn recent news, DevBootcamp and The Iron Yard announced that they are closing their doors. This is big news. DevBootcamp was the first programming bootcamp model and The Iron Yard is a national player with 15 campuses across the U.S. In both cases, the companies cited an unsustainable business model. Does that mean the boot-camp model is dead?\n\ntl;dr \u201cNope!\u201d\nBootcamps exist because traditional education models have failed to provide students job-ready skills for the 21st century. Students demand better employment options from their education. Employers demand skilled and job ready candidates. Big Education\u2019s failure to meet those needs through traditional methods created the fertile ground for the new business model of the programming bootcamp.\nEducation giant Kaplan and Apollo Education Group (owner of University of Phoenix) bought their way into this new educational model when they purchased The Iron Yard and DevBootcamp. They purchased their competition with the intent to scale up the model. Unfortunately, Big Education is too habituated to coming up short for students. They bought the upstarts that challenged them, tried making changes to run those bootcamps in the \u201cBig Education\u201d way, and, sadly, they\u2019ve closed the doors when they realized that scaling education is more challenging when student outcomes truly matter.\nThe bootcamp model is still new and there will be plenty consolidation, competition, and changes in the future. This model is based on actually being adaptive, innovative, and sustainable. And there\u2019s always room for innovation.\n\n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned at Codeup\u2026\n\n\nEducation is challenging to scale.\nPrioritizing quality over growth pays off.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing at Codeup\u2026\n\nHigher standards in our application process are leading to better student outcomes.\nOur reputation and commitment to quality is opening new doors to previously uninterested/unreachable employers.\nIn the beginning, the majority of Codeup graduates went to work with startups and small businesses. We\u2019re now seeing a larger amount of our graduates place at medium to large sized businesses.\nDemand is growing and employers are learning that the results are in the graduates.\nCodeup\u2019s model is sustainable, inclusive, and works.\n\nCall or contact us today to see how Codeup\u2019s commitment to quality and approach to being a career accelerator can make a profound difference in your life.\n"}, {"title": "Codeup Doubles Down on Transparency in Student Outcomes - Codeup", "content": "\nCodeup Doubles Down on Transparency in Student Outcomes\nStudent Outcomes and\u00a0the\u00a0Council on Integrity in Results Reporting\nWith pride and excitement, we\u2019d like to announce that Codeup is an official founding member of the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR). Codeup and all CIRR member institutions have agreed to a detailed set of student outcomes standards that eliminates unreliable graduation rates, ambiguous definitions of employment, and misleading exclusions from job placement rates.\nWe\u2019re doubling down on our commitment to long-term student success, and we\u2019re confident that CIRR will add an extra layer of value and integrity that our alumni, current students, and prospective applicants already expect from their Codeup education.\nCodeup is Committed to\u00a0Transparency\nAt all stages of the Codeup program \u2013 admissions, in-class immersion, and the job search \u2013 our staff and instructors aim to provide students with realistic advice, so they can make the most of their software development education. Historically, we\u2019ve done this in three ways:\n\nA selective admissions process that screens program applicants for motivation, professionalism, and problem-solving ability.\nTransparency with students struggling in class, or for whom software development may not be the best career path.\nA job-placement guarantee that offers graduates who maintain job-seeker status a 50 percent refund if they don\u2019t find a job within six months of graduation.\n\nEven with ongoing efforts to improve these processes that monitor student success, however, we\u2019re the first to admit that we\u2019re human. As a small, evolving program, we recognize that we can always provide students with better feedback through detailed performance evaluations, structured student one-on-ones with instructors and staff, and transparency in student outcomes data.\nOur team has already addressed evaluations and one-on-ones, but forming a consensus on bootcamp outcomes data has been an industry-wide puzzle until now.\nWe began resolving this issue by asking ourselves a follow-up question:\nWith transparency and accuracy, how do we report on students who leave Codeup or do not obtain employment?\nFortunately, other principled, results-driven coding bootcamps have asked themselves the same question, and over the past year, we\u2019ve come together under the CIRR umbrella. For the sake of our students, our alumni, and the future of our unique approach to coding education, we\u2019ve agreed to a detailed set of standards that establish new definitions, documentation, and validation requirements related to student graduation and job placement data.\nOur Students Come First\nCritical feedback from students and alumni on bootcamp outcomes has informed so much of the CIRR process. Thanks to this input, the CIRR standards support the concerns of these very students by enforcing strict standards for student outcomes reporting and, in turn, providing Codeup with even more incentive to ensure student success.\nWe appreciate our community for holding Codeup accountable to the high standard you deserve.

So what can students do instead?\nForbes Magazine ranked San Antonio as the American city with the 15th highest rate of job growth in 2015 \u2013 no surprise given our city\u2019s recent swell in tech and entrepreneurship. The boom has created a mismatch between a surplus of available jobs for developers and a shortage of local technical talent. Codeup, a career accelerator for new software developers, has begun bridging that gap by training 267 developers and creating $5.8 million in new tech salaries since 2013. \nCodeup is different from traditional models of continued education. Four-year universities and two-year technical schools often no longer serve students\u2019 needs. The recent closure of ITT Tech, one of the nation\u2019s largest for-profit educational institutions, is a great example. Tuition at schools like ITT Tech, DeVry, and Kaplan is high ($45,000 \u2013 $90,000), they have been found to use predatory lending practices, and they rank highest among colleges that leave students in the most debt. Graduates of ITT Tech San Antonio who received federal financial aid earned an average salary of only $38,400 ten years after completion, just barely above the national average for the category. Their overwhelming time commitment, high tuition fees, and limited career support make it hard for students to complete degrees and advance their careers. \nITT Tech Closes, Another Door Opens\u2026\nGiven the decline of these diploma mills and a changing jobscape, other forms of education have exploded. The new reality is that the traditional college student archetype is now a minority, while demands for alternative, dynamic educational models are only increasing. Students need a better way to enter the workforce with relevant technical skills. \u00a0\nAs a four-month intensive career accelerator, Codeup offers something special: a place where students can find like-minded peers and launch a new career. Our classroom-based program turns non-techies into software developers. In addition to excellent technical instruction, students receive one-on-one career guidance and gain opportunities to connect with employers. If a graduate cannot find employment within 6 months, Codeup offers a tuition back guarantee. We partner with multiple reputable loan and grant partners to make financing easy, and also accepts GI benefits. Graduates have increased their salary by $17K in the first year on average. \nIn light of the recent closings of ITT Tech across the country, students should pause to reconsider their educational path choices. Codeup is San Antonio local, dedicated to providing students with community, professional independence, and technical literacy. Are traditional models the best option, or might Codeup offer something better?\n"}, {"title": "Codeup's Impact on the San Antonio Tech Community - Codeup", "content": "\nCodeup\u2019s Impact on the San Antonio Tech Community\nHow Codeup Supports the San Antonio Tech Community\nAfter joining Codeup in early 2016, I quickly realized what sets us apart from other coding bootcamps: community.\nCodeup leads community development by sponsoring free learn-to-code workshops, monthly coding challenges, regular developer meetups, and closely partnering with many local companies around tech centered events. \u00a0We also hosted the Big Data Code-a-thon, a civic-minded hackathon, which allowed local software developers to use water data to create amazing new software for the Edwards Aquifer Authority. \u00a0Codeup consistently drives growth in the number of skilled developers available in the SA tech community by educating hundreds of budding software developers. \u00a0As early as our first class,\u00a0Codeup contributed to doubling the number of software developers employed at Geekdom. \u00a0\nNurturing New Talent\nOur team is proud to offer GI Bill support, job placement services, top-notch career planning workshops, and a diverse student population. 62% of Codeup students are minorities and 24% are women.

Be\u00a0sure you\u2019ll have lots of access to experienced, passionate\u00a0instructors.\nQuality over quantity.\u00a0Be wary of schools\u00a0with lots of campuses. You don\u2019t want to end up at a diploma mill!\nIn-person, not online!\u00a0Schools with in-person\u00a0learning environments produce\u00a0better programmers.\nDo they put their money where their mouth is? Check out the school\u2019s job placement opportunities and/or job guarantee.\nNetworking! Ask about how the school gets students\u00a0integrated in the local tech community.\nKeep an eye on funding options, especially those from non-profit sources. Even if you don\u2019t qualify for a grant or scholarship, it means the school has been vetted by third parties.\n\n1. Lots of 1:1\u00a0Time with Qualified, Experienced Instructors\nWe\u2019ve all dealt with disengaged teachers, but at a good program, you shouldn\u2019t have to. Be sure that there\u2019s a full staff of bona fide instructors that maximize individual attention and mutual accountability.\nLook for three things in your programming instruction: actual work experience in the industry (not just at the bootcamp!), a passion for teaching, and access to one-on-one tutoring.\nCollege computer science courses are heavy on theory, light on useful applications. That\u2019s great for some folks, but a good immersive coding program gives you the tools you need to get a job, and it\u2019s best to learn from people who\u2019ve been using them to build creations\u00a0of their own. When reviewing instructors\u2019 credentials, look past the fancy degrees and give brownie points for web development jobs and industry savvy.\nWith that in mind, some of the most\u00a0brilliant software developers\u00a0simply aren\u2019t the greatest teachers. You want to be sure your instructors love interacting with students, explaining\u00a0complex concepts to beginners, and offering one-on-one help whenever needed.\nAlso, when possible, be sure to do a campus visit and meet the instructional staff. The program staff should always be open to this.\n2. Fewer\u00a0Locations = Higher\u00a0Quality\nAlright, I\u2019ll say it. Be wary of coding schools with multiple campuses. Some bootcamps are\u00a0decent in one city and terrible in another. It\u2019s much easier for a program\u00a0to give you quality, individualized attention when the staff and instructors aren\u2019t answering to people in a different time zone.\nThere\u2019s decades of evidence for this.\u00a0The country\u2019s best universities hunker down in one spot and focus on student success. Money-hungry diploma mills have locations in strip malls from coast-to-coast, some of which are known for high dropout rates and have been banned from recruiting military personnel. As with any decision in higher ed,\u00a0choosing a focused coding bootcamp makes all the difference.\n3. Immersion\nYou\u2019ve probably heard people compare learning programming to learning\u00a0spoken languages. There are lots of similarities, but there\u2019s a big one\u00a0to keep in mind: immersion. Both types of languages are learned best through using the language all day, every day, with other people, for an extended period of time.\nA coding bootcamp worth your time\u00a0should provide a collaborative environment that immerses you in code. You\u2019ll be able to sharpen your new skills alongside a team of experts and vetted fellow students. Instructors push you to the next level, and when the going gets tough, you can always ask one of your bright classmates\u2014a whole group of bright classmates, in fact!\n4. A Stellar Job Placement Record\nWhat\u2019s the end game of any good coding program? Getting you a well-paid job at a company you like!\nFirst, check out the schools\u2019s job placement rate. If their admissions strategy and teaching are solid, it should be north of 90% over six months. This means they\u2019re accepting students who will succeed as developers, not just anyone who can pay the tuition.\nNext, take a look at the list of companies where alumni take jobs. Are they all funneled into one industry? What\u2019s the ratio of startups to corporations? A diverse set of post-grad placements suggests you\u2019ll learn the programming skills necessary to succeed in any work environment.\nAlso, make sure the school\u00a0is willing to put its money where its mouth is. Good programs should guarantee you a job in a timely fashion or else give you a significant refund.\nWould you rather start something of your own? Even better! Keep reading below.\n5. Ecosystem, Ecosystem, Ecosystem\nThe tech industry thrives in areas where entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and developers\u2014i.e., you!\u2014can easily get together and make the magic happen.\nCollaborative workspaces, like Geekdom in San Antonio, allow entrepreneurs to build new business and products together. Notable local tech companies like Rackspace and top-tier startup accelerators are also key indicators of a healthy ecosystem and provide important funding sources for new ventures. Cities with diverse, technology-heavy industries (e.g., healthcare, military, energy, aeronautics, automotive, and advanced manufacturing) also offer a strong commercial base to support tech entrepreneurs and job seekers.\nAs you start to build things, it\u2019s also nice to be in a somewhat smaller ecosystem. Getting in on\u00a0the ground floor of a growing\u00a0tech scene gives you access\u00a0to willing and able mentors. Smaller tech cities also tend to have\u00a0lower costs of living. A new software engineer often finds it helpful to be a big fish in a friendly, easy-to-navigate pond, where the tech community\u2019s got her back in times of success and failure.\n6.\u00a0Ample Funding Options\nKeep an eye out for schools with various funding options. Many offer loans that allow students to defer payments until after graduation. That\u2019s a huge\u00a0plus, but you should also ask about\u00a0non-profit tuition grants\u00a0and scholarships. And should you not qualify for these benefits, at least you can rest assured that third parties have vetted your school and its leadership is serious increasing access to education.\nSo\u2026which coding bootcamp is right for you?\nImmersive coding programs can get you started on an exciting new career path. That said, big life transitions aren\u2019t easy. It\u2019s important to find the right program, and we encourage all applicants to\u00a0vet their options\u00a0for how well each school\u00a0teaches and accommodates their students.\nIf you have any questions or comments about Codeup, or anything else, we\u2019d love to hear from you! Please feel free to\u00a0send an email to info@codeup.com or schedule a phone call.\u00a0We\u2019ll be in touch shortly.\n"}, {"title": "Open for (Bitcoin) Business - Codeup", "content": "\nOpen for (Bitcoin) Business\nAt Codeup, we guide students through 18 weeks of rigorous curriculum and equip them with a comprehensive understanding of software development. We designed our program to challenge students in a number of areas, but financing is not one of them. That\u2019s why we offer various financial options, enabling students to pay for Codeup with the funding plan that works best for them.\nSince we are always looking to accommodate the needs of our students, we recently added another form of payment to our list of funding options. James Canning, a current student who went through Codeup\u2019s application and on-boarding process from overseas, was able to pay the program fee entirely with bitcoin! Here is what he had to say about the experience:\nI recently started the full-time web development boot camp at Codeup in San Antonio, Texas. Codeup is one of the most comprehensive and best-reviewed developer training programs available. One of the main reasons I chose Codeup is because I was able to pay in bitcoin, the currency in which I receive my income.\nI always ask businesses I might transact with if they accept bitcoin; in the case of Codeup, I included this paragraph when I emailed them to enquire about the course:\n\u201cBy the way, if Codeup accepted bitcoin for payments it would be very beneficial for both parties. With a payment processor like Bitpay or Coinbase, Codeup gets instant USDs in its bank account for less than half the fees of credit cards or PayPal with 0 chargebacks and 0 fraud.\u201d\nBecause Codeup does their invoicing through QuickBooks, they easily added the bitcoin payments option with QuickBooks\u2019 excellent PayByCoin feature, which uses Bitpay, the same processor Microsoft, Namecheap, Newegg and others use.\nCodeup emailed me the invoice as normal and I was able to pay the program fee in moments, from anywhere in the world.\nI will post a full review after the course, but so far the boot camp is excellent. Codeup achieves a friendly and supportive atmosphere and is thoroughly integrated into the local tech scene. Over 90% of graduates from the first four classes received job offers in the 6 months following the course. Personally I am not taking the course to get hired but rather to take my site, Bitedge, to the next level.\nIf you want to learn web development and pay in bitcoin, then Codeup is by far the best option. If you use QuickBooks for your invoicing you should enable bitcoin payments!\n\nYou can catch the full version of James\u2019 story here.\n"}, {"title": "A Guide to Hiring Fresh Technical Talent - Codeup", "content": "\nA Guide to Hiring Fresh Technical Talent\nWe\u2019ve watched many employers learn how to hire fresh technical talent since we started Codeup in 2013. Now that many of our grads have 18+ months of work experience, we spoke to employers to determine best practices for hiring Codeup grads. We saw some common themes that can help other employers. Here\u2019s what they said.\nClassical tech interviewing techniques (\u201cSolve this problem without recursion on this whiteboard while we stare at you!\u201d) aren\u2019t always as useful.\n\n\u201cYou must understand that this is a junior dev and probably has less than a year of coding experience. You must interview for aptitude and attitude. I usually perform at least 2-3 interviews, starting out with a behavioral interview, then perform a programming and problem solving interview. I usually ask a question that is not solvable (in the allotted time of the interview). I do this on purpose to see how they manage tough problems and difficult situations, from both an intellectual and emotional perspective.\u201d\n\u201cThe best practice is always to have the grads interview with different people in the team. Each person assess one specific area of expertise. So we normally have three interviews focus on each of the following aspects:\n\nPersonality and cultural fit (previous projects/jobs, experience, drive, motivation, likes and dislikes, strengths and soft skills)\nCoding Assessment (In this one we try to simulate a work environment in which the interviewer is already part of the team and helps us come up with a feature/solution for a specific customer request. We go over analysis, database design, some white board coding for specific functions and sometimes even GUI design)\nTechnical Assessment. Questions are asked about specific technologies and also we like to focus on their capstone project and what role/part they had during its development. We evaluate how well they can explain their project and the tasks that they performed.\u201d\n\n\n\nHiring fresh talent requires a different mindset and approach to growing a tech organization.\n\n\u201cEarly on we put new grads on pet projects \u2013 usually something internal that was a contrived project. We quickly discovered that real world projects were a much better starting point. Typically we have them start with writing automated tests, then slowly give them more demanding work as their skill sets develop.\u201d\n\u201cBe honest with yourself about what your needs are and what your company is hiring for. Bootcamp grads need mentorship and time to develop and progress within an organization.\u201d\n\nAn experienced mentor and development plan are essential.\n\n\u201cUnderstand that you are making an investment. If you make a wise selection and couple that with strong mentorship you can end up with great talent.\u201d\n\u201cPairing an entry-level developer with more experienced team members has worked well for us. We also like to get our newly graduated developers into real code as soon as possible. There is no better way to learn than solid keyboard time.\u201d\n\u201cWhat has worked best so far is to get them into support tasks immediately, so\u00a0they get familiar with the code, the architecture, the product and the customers and the learning curve, although a little more aggressive, is reduced. This way while fixing bugs or doing QA they learn the most complex and hidden parts of our system which triggers the right questions.\u201c\n\nSmart management and hiring approaches still apply.\n\n\u201cProviding a mix of focused assignments within their skills set along with some stretch assignments and mentorship maximizes their development.\u201c\n\u201cHaving an onboarding plan is a must with 1 month, 3 month, 6 month targets. Provide the developer with tutorials and find assignments where the tools and knowledge that they have at a particular point will allow them to succeed at completing such assignment. Furthermore, weekly 1:1\u2019s are crucial.\u201d\n\u201cWith one of my hires, even though I didn\u2019t feel very strong in their ability, I hired based on attitude with a hope that over time, they would become a better developer. I found that they (again because of their attitude) excelled with customer support, so they found their place there instead of development.\u201d\n\nEntry-level talent can positively impact team attitudes and fulfilment amongst senior staff\n\n\u201cHaving entry-level people can be a great way to add energy to a team, and allows more senior developers the opportunity to mentor and teach their craft to others.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019d love to see how we can help your company grow its tech talent pipeline.

You\u2019ll like them as much as we do when you see what they have to offer.\nHere\u2019s what they have to say for themselves, in their own words:\n\nA PARTNERSHIP TO INVEST IN YOUR\u00a0CODEUP EXPERIENCE & SUCCESS\nSkills Fund\u2019s goal is simple: we don\u2019t finance students to attend crappy programs. For this\u00a0reason, we work daily to build the best financing tools for leading bootcamps and their students.\n\n\u2023 Fixed interest rates: 8.49% for 36 months; 10.49% for 60 months\n\u2023 Finance up to $15,000 (tuition \u2013 deposit) of program costs\n\u2023 Interest-only payments while in program and for 60 days following graduation\n\u2023 Transparent loan terms: understand your interest rate before applying\n\u2023 10 minutes to complete your application.

Organizations like Rails Girls are fueling the fire by providing women and girls with the tools and community they need to learn, and to be confident with new coding skills. This week, Rails Girls is putting on a free, two-day workshop in San Antonio where they will teach women how to program using Ruby on Rails.\nAt Codeup, we\u2019re all about community, collaboration, and partnership. It\u2019s our lifeblood to be an integrated force in San Antonio\u2019s landscape of blooming, new tech talent. We also work to fuel the dreams, goals and future potential of women in tech careers. So when we heard about the upcoming Rails Girls workshop, we only had one question, which we managed to sandwich between our fangirl squeals: Can we partner with you?!\n\u00a0\nThey said yes, we cried tears of joy, and our shared mission has us both super invested in the success of the upcoming workshop. How are we investing? Well, our time, treasure, and talent are the best things we can give! Two of our esteemed team members, an instructor and one of our curriculum developers, as well as our co-founder and his team of developers, will be participating as on-site mentors to help facilitate the learning process. As educators and friends, these folks embody who we are and what we do at Codeup. Here\u2019s their take on the weekend\u2019s programming festivities:\nRyan Orsinger, our full-stack bootcamp instructor, says, \u201cRails Girls makes a global impact for gender parity in the programming community. Codeup makes an impact for gender parity in the San Antonio programming community.\u201d It\u2019s a perfect match of shared goals!\nRyan goes on to say that his \u201cdecision to volunteer as a coach for Rails Girls is simple. Programming is the new literacy, and everyone should have exposure and experience in this field. I\u2019m thrilled that San Antonio will be hosting its first (of many) Rails Girls workshops.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Agreed, Ryan.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNow, meet Tarek Hafez, a curriculum developer here at Codeup:\nTarek is passionate about learning and growing from the challenges he faces, and as a volunteer at Rails Girls he hopes to share his passion and knowledge with others. \u201cI can help to motivate and inspire those I seek to mentor, as well as educate,\u201d said Tarek, \u201cI could not ask for a better opportunity.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnother awesome supporter of Rails Girls from our community is Jason Straughan, a Codeup cofounder, our CTO, and founder and head guy in charge of everything at a Grok Interactive, a web application development company. He\u2019s sending his developers to also mentor the event.\n\u201cLouis, Anton, and Joseph and I are going to be coaches for Rails Girls\u2026I\u2019m pumped,\u201d said Josh Freeman, senior software developer and former instructor for Codeup teen summer coding camps. Not only that, Joseph is a also Codeup-grad-turned-Grok-developer! According to Josh, the developers at Grok are never done learning and studying, an ideal that \u201cmeshes well with Rails Girls, where you\u2019re trying to train and introduce new people to programming. That\u2019s why we jumped at the opportunity.\u201d Although the Rails Girls workshop will only be in San Antonio for a weekend, the organization has already planted its compelling, and contagious, vision in our city.\nIn our coding bootcamps people come in with dreams, hopes, fears, and wonder. Can I do this? Can I really learn a new set of skills in four months, become a valuable developer, and end up with a completely new job, new life, and new trajectory? And women especially bring a different set of sensitivity and caution. We meet their wise concerns with a great confidence-building foundation of real skills to maximize their value in the tech landscape. Can I really do this? Is there room for me in the 73% tech industry? Can I make a difference?\nGreat questions. And we answer them with a resounding yes because we see it happen again, and again, and again.\n*You may still be able to snag a spot at this weekend\u2019s workshop!

LaunchCode\u2019s employer partner network spans over 300 companies nationwide, ranging from smaller startups to big-name companies like MasterCard, all in need of tech talent. \nAnd that\u2019s where we come in. \nAfter four months of intensive bootcamp immersion, our grads have some serious skills. Thanks to this partnership, our grads will gain access to a world of job placement and paid apprenticeship opportunities so they can put their new skill set into action.\nOur bootcamps are a nontraditional, effective way to learn to code. Many companies already recognize and benefit from the value of bootcamp grads, but some are still unsure of how to best integrate them into a team. One thing that makes LaunchCode an ideal partner for us is that their model creates opportunities for driven programmers, regardless of whether or not they have traditional credentials. And this model is working: over 90% of LaunchCode\u2019s apprenticeships are converted to full-time hires within 90 days.\nYou may be thinking \u201cBut Codeup, don\u2019t you already have a stellar hiring rate?\u201d \nTo which we reply: Staaaahp. We\u2019re blushing. But to answer your question, yes. While 94% of our graduates find work within 6 months, we are always aiming to increase opportunities for students post bootcamp. Before the partnership, we were working within a network of 64 partner employers, many of which are based here in San Antonio. By teaming up with LaunchCode, we\u2019re\u00a0expanding our connections beyond San Antonio, so our grads will be able to find their dream jobs not just locally, but across the nation!

At the same time, it\u2019s clear that we need to do more to get those young people ready to succeed in the tech workforce.\nI personally spoke to over a hundred job seekers, and my booth-mate Dylan did, too.\nWe talked with dozens of recent computer science grads of local colleges and universities. They wanted entry-level jobs, but when I asked, \u201cWhat have you built that is real?\u201d, they pointed to toy applications and homework assignments. The students succeeded in their coursework \u2013 the curriculum simply didn\u2019t arm them with applied, job-ready skills.\nWe also spoke to employers and saw which jobs the employers were looking to fill. All of the recruiters were targeting senior and mid-level technical positions. The big company employers were searching for the same.\nIt\u2019s clear that San Antonio is getting good at producing entry-level talent, but we still have a huge gap in technical ability. The main takeaway after talking to both job seekers and job givers is that the San Antonio workforce isn\u2019t where tech employers want it to be. It\u2019s the responsibility of both the educators and the employers to become much more involved in solving that problem.\nMoving forward, there are two challenges for us as a community. First, educational programs (including Codeup) need to continue to evolve and guide talent beyond entry-level skills.

Below is a Q&A from the end of his presentation.\nHow do you differentiate between\u00a0proof of concept, prototype,\u00a0minimum viable product, and customer validation when coaching students?\nThe first thing to ask is, \u201cwhat\u2019s the true value proposition?\u201d. So, \u201cwhat\u2019s the \u2018it\u2019 that\u2019s really going to be valuable?\u201d. The second questions is, \u201cwho is the customer?\u201d. You really need to understand your customer better than they understand him or herself. That means talking to customers, that means working with customers, that means actually going to people and saying, \u201clook I have this idea what do you think?\u201d. So define the true value proposition you\u2019re trying to provide, and then match that with real customers and real customer needs.\nThen the second step, once you make that connection and validate that value proposition with a customer match, is actually getting the \u201cit\u201d in front of somebody, or a version of the \u201cit\u201d in front of somebody to be able to sense whether or not it\u2019s really going to be viable.\nInvestors love you, but they love paying customers best. So between you and the investor, there\u2019s the prototype, there\u2019s the app that helps convince them there really is a path forward and not just some guys who\u2019s nice to talk to but has nothing to offer.\nHave you begun to see\u00a0more entrepreneurial models and educational approaches in high schools or middle schools across the United States?\nThere\u2019s a lot of stuff going on right now in high schools and middle schools, who are just beginning [entrepreneurship]. \u00a0Venture Labs, which is just down the street [from Codeup], is doing some really great work in trying to put that into the curriculum. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a fad or if it will be here permanently, but we are seeing a lot more of it. We\u2019re also seeing a lot more young college students getting involved in entrepreneurship.\nWhat do you think about crowdsourcing platforms as a means of defining value proposition and finding customers and funding?\nI love crowdsourcing and crowdfunding, I think it\u2019s a great way of determining whether your thing\u00a0is the upcoming thing\u00a0that people wanna buy. The problem with crowdsourcing is that there\u2019s just a lot of crap out there and there\u2019s a lot of people who are not only selling you something, but a whole bunch of stuff that you\u2019re not gonna get. So it\u2019s great if you\u2019re doing it for real and using it for the right reasons.\nFrom the inventor/startup side, it\u2019s a phenomenal way of being able to say, \u201cwe have 5,000 people who want to buy our special sauce and so now we\u2019ve taken that money we\u2019re gonna go bottle that sauce.\u201d But I urge you all to think about what the next thing is going to be. What\u2019s after crowdsourcing? We\u2019re already seeing a variety of that with equity crowdfunding, but is there something else that can be the next thing? When we think about the principles of crowdfunding, is there an opportunity to leapfrog and go just above that curve of innovation to be the first entrant, or occupy that first niche that does something differently?\nIf your startup idea is an adaptation or modernization (a faster wheel, so to speak) of an earlier product, does the process of developing that idea change?\nIt\u2019s still the same, but it makes selling it easier. It\u2019s like, \u201cFacebook for cats,\u201d like, \u201cSea World without large mammals,\u201d like, \u201cUber, but for boats.\u201d It\u2019s easier to sell; there\u2019s a higher likelihood that you know who your customer are, because there are people using it already.\nThe challenge is that some of the big companies are already thinking about those things and they have chosen not to pursue them for various reasons. The good news for startups is that maybe the reasons corporate companies chose not to pursue are the exact reasons why you should choose to pursue them as a startup: because they\u2019re too big, too bureaucratic to understand the real opportunity, or they chose to pass on it.\nBe careful with an idea that\u2019s similar to what other people are doing. Do your due diligence. Sometimes the patent literature is in the library and you can thumb through and see there was this old company that had that same idea 20 years ago, who then got bought out, and got bought, and got bought out, and no one ever did anything with it. Now if you\u00a0just tweak that idea\u2013by taking what they did and marrying it with the cloud, marrying it with crowdsourcing, marrying it with an app platform, social media\u2013you will then be able to see the right opportunity. If those guys are still around, it might be worth finding them and asking, \u201cwhatever happened to that?\u201d.\nElevator pitch versus Ted Talk?\nYou will need different pitches for different audiences at different times, so have them all ready. You should have your 10 second elevator pitch, your 2 sentence explanation of what you do, your 3 minute pitch, your Ted Talk; you should have a deck for an investors with appendices, a deck for sales to sell your thing. There are different kinds of ways of presenting for different kinds of audiences; have all of those presentations relatively polished so when that opportunity presents itself, you can pitch it right then. Be ready.\nStart with outlining the technically detailed way to say what you\u2019re trying to say to other engineers, computer scientists, people who are in the field who do and see the need and will be able to make the thing that \u00a0you need to make. Then, think of the 35,000-foot big-picture version of what you\u2019re trying to say, and sort of in between those is the rest of the world.\n"}, {"title": "Exploring New Domains: ICANN's gTLD Program - Codeup", "content": "\nExploring New Domains: ICANN\u2019s gTLD Program\n\u00a0\nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a\u00a0non-profit organization responsible for maintaining the global Domain Name System (DNS), is in the middle of rolling out its new gTLD program,\u00a0which has\u00a0the\u00a0potential to\u00a0reshape how\u00a0users find information on the internet and\u00a0how\u00a0organizations build their identities online.\nKevin Kopas, Channel Manager for Radix Registry, stopped by the Codeup classroom to help students better understand the gTLD program and\u00a0how\u00a0it\u00a0may transform the\u00a0domain\u00a0industry over the next few years.\nWhat is a domain, anyway?\nDomains are identifiers that create spaces of authority within the internet. A domain reflects an Internet Protocol address (IP address), which links\u00a0to the server where a website is hosted. \u00a0Domains are organized according to a hierarchical model consisting of top-level, second-level, and lower-level domains.\nTop-level domains (TLDs) constitute the highest level of domains in the DNS.\u00a0There are many types of TLDs\u2013including country codes\u00a0like\u00a0.us, .uk, and .jp\u2013and Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs), such as .com, .info, .edu, and .org. gTLDs are operated and managed by registries, like\u00a0Radix.\nSecond and lower-level domains\u00a0directly follow TLDs and\u00a0are located to the left of the \u201c.\u201d in a domain. For a visual, in the domain \u201ccodeup20.wpengine.com,\u201d \u00a0\u201c.com\u201d \u00a0is the gTLD and \u201ccodeup\u201d is the second-level domain.\u00a0Typically, registries\u00a0delegate the responsibility of allotting domain names to registrars, such as\u00a0GoDaddy.\nHow is the domain industry changing?\nUntil recently, the list of gTLDs was limited to traditional strings, like the previously-mentioned .com and .net, as well as .gov, .mil, .org. and .edu. Over the years, the number of desirable and available second and third-level domains associated with these gTLDs has become increasingly scarce.\nTo diversify the pool of available domains, ICANN is in the process of introducing\u00a01300+ new gTLDs.\u00a0These include everything from\u00a0.baby, .mls, .dot, \u00a0and .realty, to .sucks, and .buy.\u00a0Radix has acquired eight new gTLDs, including .space, and .website, and will soon be offering .tech.\nRegistries can apply for a new gTLD through ICANN. In the case that multiple registries apply for the same gTLD, those companies partake in an\u00a0auction to determine the winner. ICANN runs its own auction to solve these contention sets; however, companies have found ways to resolve these disputes before reaching ICANN\u00a0through private auctions like Applicant Auction, which have their own rules and regulations. Sometimes companies even negotiate deals on their own instead of conducting\u00a0a private auction.\nThe winning price for each gTLD varies. Registries often play a high-stakes guessing game where big\u00a0prices have the potential for big returns. For example, on the low end of the\u00a0March 2015\u00a0ICANN auction \u00a0, .srl was purchased for $400,000; on the high end, Google purchased .app for $25 million.\nWhat does this mean for the web?\nIn Kopas\u2019 opinion, slowly but surely, the .coms and .nets of the world will become overpowered by more specific gTLDs. While the impending end of the .com era may be sad for some, this shift also opens up new opportunity for creativity and specificity in a company\u2019s branding and marketing.\nWith a more diverse list of available gTLDS, companies can better align their web presences with their\u00a0products or services: a beauty salon could use\u00a0.salon or an independent realtor could use .realtor. On the flip side, users will be able to tailor their searches based on a company\u2019s gTLD. This change also has the potential to offer credibility to businesses in certain industries. For example, in order to obtain a .law domain, the applicant must be a licensed practitioner.\nBut will these new gTLDs ever really become the norm? Will\u00a0Google\u2019s $25 million investment in .app produce a sizable ROI? Only time will tell. In order for this shift to happen, consumers\u00a0must understand the industry and recognize the new variety of available gTLDs. Thanks to Kopas,\u00a0Codeup students are now \u201cin the know\u201d\u00a0about the changing domain of domains!\nFor more info on the upcoming gTLD changes, check out ICANN\u2019s FAQ page.\nTo hear about how applicants plan to use the new gTLDs, watch ICANN\u2019s video series.\n"}, {"title": "Using Git as a Communication Tool - Codeup", "content": "\nUsing Git as a Communication Tool\nAs Josh Freeman of Grok Interactive shared with our students during a lunchtime talk, it\u2019s extremely important to maintain quality communication when working on a project.\nGit, while primarily a tool for version control, can be used to facilitate this kind of interaction. Freeman recommends two simple steps to maximize communication in Git.\n1. Use the Git commit as an opportunity to increase communication by explaining the changes you make to your code, as opposed to explaining it in a comment.\nSet up a Git commit template, or a standardized layout for commit messages. Freeman\u2019s template is listed below. Don\u2019t forget, your commit message summary must be 50 characters or less; all other lines should be under 72 characters.\n(Configuring your Git commit template)\nExample Git Commit Template:\n2. Organize your commits logically.\nSections of code that don\u2019t relate to each other shouldn\u2019t be committed together. Instead, break your code into logical sections and commit each section separately.\nYou can accomplish this by adding to the index in patches, which allows you to stage parts of files and provides finer control over what you commit. Maintaining an organization to your commits will make it much easier to communicate via the commit template.\n(Adding to the index in patches)\nFollowing these two simple Git guidelines can prevent frustration that arises when deciphering code. Communication is key not only for your current team members, but also for your future self or future developers who may inherit your code sometime down the line.\n"}, {"title": "The Delorean Gets a Ride - Codeup", "content": "\nThe Delorean Gets a Ride\nOur beloved Delorean took a ride in the tow truck today.

Read on for\u00a0six SEO takeaways from his presentation.\n1. Make your title tag effective.\nThe title tag, or the text written on the tab of your website, is a huge factor in your SEO ranking and should be as simple and straightforward as possible. The title tag is not the place for creative metaphors or puns: if your website is about finding cheap flights, the word \u201ccheap flights\u201d should most definitely be in your title tag.\n2. Keep your key words simple and specific.\nLikewise, the keywords you choose to emphasize on your website\u2013especially the keywords within the first block of content on the homepage\u2013should convey your purpose as concisely and simply as possible.\n3. \u201cDon\u2019t half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing.\u201d\nBorrowing from the wisdom of Parks and Rec\u2019s Ron Swanson, this quote means you should avoid spreading the same keywords across multiple pages on your site. Decide early on which keywords you want on each page and stick to it. If you need to reuse a keyword on a separate page, you can always put it in an image (which Google can\u2019t read) or link it back to the original page where the keyword is emphasized.\n4. Don\u2019t use \u201cclick here\u201d on your website.\nNever use the words, \u201cclick here\u201d on your website to direct users to links or documents. \u201cClick here\u201d has been used so frequently to link to Adobe PDFs that, when you Google it, Adobe Reader is the first or second item listed. Using \u201cclick here\u201d can actually hurt your SEO. Instead, use a link title that describes the\u00a0content\u00a0to which it\u2019s linking.\nExample:\n\u201cFor more information about Codeup\u2019s Teen SummerCamp, click here.\u201d = WRONG!\n\u201cLearn more about Codeup\u2019s Teen SummerCamp.\u201d = RIGHT!\n5. Make shareable content.\nShareable content, like a free brochure or infographic, can increase the amount of people linking to your site. When it comes to SEO, quality links are golden. You want as many quality links as you can get!\n6. Ensure your site is mobile-friendly.\nGoogle is changing their algorithm (again) to factor in a site\u2019s mobile-friendliness. This change is set to be released during the week of April 21st, 2015. If you want to maximize your SEO (and minimize mobile users\u2019 frustration when browsing your site), you must ensure that your website uses responsive design. Not sure if your site is responsive? Use Google\u2019s free mobile friendliness test\u00a0to find out.\n"}, {"title": "What is the Value of a Codeup Education? - Codeup", "content": "\nWhat is the Value of a Codeup Education?\nThis is a guest article\u00a0by Michael Taylor, originally posted at The Rivard Report\u00a0and Bankers Anonymous.\n\u00a0\nLike many, I see education from a combination of angles. Unquestionably, education makes us broader thinkers and more sparkling conversationalists. Education makes us more actualized humans.\nBut as a finance guy, a small evil part of me always applies the $64,000 Wall Street question to every activity \u2013 from brushing my teeth to tossing a ball with a (in my case, non-existent) dog. [1] It\u2019s the bottom-line question: \u201cHow is this making me money, like, right now?\u201d [2]\nOne of the problems of education, generally, is that we have a hard time proving or quantifying its value. What is the value of holding your shoulders back and head high when you walk into a job interview, knowing you\u2019re the best they\u2019re going to interview that week? Or the value of the feeling, when given a work assignment, of \u201cBoom! I got this!\u201d\nPhilosophically, how can you put a value on just knowing more stuff?\nCODEUP\nThe weird thing about my friend Michael Girdley \u2013 who started the computer coding school\u00a0Codeup \u2013 is that he\u2019s ambitious enough to say that the education community tradition of waving a hand at hard-to-measure fuzzy feelings is not good enough. Just because the education community finds it difficult to measure value doesn\u2019t mean that business people shouldn\u2019t try.\nIn less than two years he\u2019s established a pattern of tracking data on the most important finance question of education.\u00a0By that, I mean the bottom-line question: How is this making me money, like, right now?\u00a0Girdley shared with me the pre-Codeup and post-Codeup earnings of his students, along with some useful stats on entry-level and mid-career web developer salaries.\nUsing a couple of his statistics, I want to take a stab at figuring out the total value, right now, of a student\u2019s investment in Codeup.\nSTATISTIC #1:\n\u201cThe average Codeup graduate saw her annual salary jump $13,035 in the year after graduation from the program.\u201d\nWhat does that really mean? What can you do with that number if you plan, say, 30 working years at this higher salary?\nIt would be great to say that a Codeup education is worth 30 times $13,035, or $391,050. However, money in the future is not as valuable to me as money today, so that calculation is not quite accurate.\u00a0I mean, you could figure it, but finance guys will give you the\u00a0time value of money\u00a0speech that you don\u2019t want to hear again.\nWith a salary increase of just $13,035, we can\u00a0calculate\u00a0what that amount is worth today by using a\u00a0discounted cashflow formula. So let\u2019s be sophisticated and apply our discounted cashflow formula to 30 years of earnings, elevated by $13,035.\nI have to assume a \u201cdiscount rate,\u201d which is some combination of taking into account inflation and future investment risks. I\u2019m going to assume a 5% discount rate. [3] Using my 5% discount rate, I estimate the value today of my elevated salary to be $200,379.90. That\u2019s the sum of 30 years\u2019 worth of $13,035, but \u201cdiscounted,\u201d or translated back, into today\u2019s dollars.\nThat discounting allows us to more accurately compare the $16,000 tuition for Codeup with the total financial value, today, of that education.\u00a0By that measure, you pay Codeup $16K today for something worth on average, $200K,\u00a0today. [4] Another way of putting it is\u00a0that you are buying something today worth 12.5 times that amount. With these numbers, Codeup sounds like pretty good deal.\u00a0\nSTATISTIC #2:\n\u201cThe average web developer, nationally, earns $91,750. That\u2019s $61,525 more than the average pre-Codeup salary of surveyed Codeup students.\u201d\nSo that\u2019s interesting.\nWe can imagine a number of reasons for this difference which don\u2019t have to do with the value of Codeup. Maybe the average web developer is older and more experienced on the job than the average pre-Codeup student. Maybe national salaries are higher than San Antonio salaries, on average.\nI mean, I\u2019m sure they are.\nBut still. If one of your goals is to swim in a higher-paid talent pool, it might pay to learn the butterfly stroke.\nHow much would 15 peak years of earning $61,525 more than you earn now be worth, like, right now?\u00a0Again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as high as 15 times $61,525, or $922,875, because of the whole discounted cashflow of\u00a0money in the future not being worth as much money today.\u00a0Also, to be fair, you probably won\u2019t earn the average national salary until you had a few years to ramp up your career.\nBut what about discounting 15 years of an additional $61,525 per year, at a 5% rate, starting 5 years from now, using the exact same formula that we used before? [5] Discounting those 15 years of earning the average industry salary gives me a value, today, of $500,366.44.\u00a0Which, to state the obvious, is 31X the price of tuition.\nWith those kinds of numbers I start to feel like that sales guy from Entourage: \u201cWhat if I was to tell you that you\u2019d pay $16,000 tuition to Codeup for something worth $500K today? Is that something you might be interested in?\u201d\nLook, seriously, there are a lot of assumptions embedded in my statement that \u201cyou could pay $16K in tuition today for future salary jumps worth $500K, today.\u201d\nMost important of these is the assumption that, by training as a programmer, you can earn the national average salary for programming jobs. And we all know there\u2019s no guarantee that happens.\nBut \u2013 and this is a big but [6] \u2013 it\u2019s not a crazy assumption.\u00a0Because, really, it\u2019s an assumption that the average happens.\nIt\u2019s an assumption that you could be paid what other people in your industry are generally paid. It\u2019s an assumption that markets are somewhat efficient. \u00a0It\u2019s an assumption that, if you have valuable skills, you can find employers and work situations just like other people.\nAll of which makes me pretty confident that the financial return on a skills upgrade like Codeup can be somewhere between 12 and 31 times the upfront tuition cost.\nBACK TO THE VALUE OF AN EDUCATION\nAs I said before, education leads to more sparkling conversations as well as to a more fully actualized life. Of that, I have no doubt.\nBut I appreciate my friend Girdley\u2019s business-like approach to showing that the value of his program can be somewhere between a 12 and 31 times multiple of your investment.\u00a0Just thinking like a finance guy, is that something you might be interested in?\n\u2014\u2014\u2013\n[1] Notice I haven\u2019t gotten a dog because \u2013 I ask you \u2013 where\u2019s the profit in that?\n[2] I\u2019m still working on monetizing my teeth-brushing.\n[3] How did I come up with 5%? Sorta kinda I used art in addition to science. You could call inflation 2%, so that\u2019s a baseline for discounting the value of money in the future. Then there\u2019s the future risk of actually earning the elevated salary, which after all is a big assumption, and also an average, and as we always say in finance \u2018results may vary, past performance is no predictor of future results, etc,\u2019 so there\u2019s a few % points added to the inflation rate to account for that kind of risk. If you don\u2019t like my 5% assumption, make your own, I can\u2019t promise you I\u2019m \u201cright\u201d about a 5% discount rate. You might be just as right with a different assumption. Also, remember the faux philosopher and native San Antonian Jack Handey is a good guide to these disagreements: \u201cInstead of having \u2018answers\u2019 on a math test, they should just call them \u2018impressions,\u2019 and if you got a different \u2018impression,\u2019 so what, can\u2019t we all be brothers?\u201d\n[4] In addition to the $16K tuition of course you have to do a lot of work to not only learn to code, but also, you know, earn a salary in the future. So there\u2019s still that whole \u2018work\u2019 problem. But if you have to work, it\u2019s nice for the finance part to at least make sense, no?\n[5] Why did I choose 15 years and not 30 this time? Mostly because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to assume a Codeup graduate\u2019s salary jumps immediately to the average national salary. You work up to that. For that same reason, I calculated the value with a 5 year delay, to account for a slow ramp-up. Again, Jack Handey comes to mind: \u201cIf you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You see, we build to that.\u201d\n[6] Hhhnn-huh. Heh.

Front-end = what you see; back-end = how it works.\nFront-end\nThese days, front-end development refers to the part of the web users interact with. In the past, web development consisted of people who worked with Photoshop and those who could code HTML and CSS. Now, developers need a handle of programs like Photoshop and coding in not only in HTML and CSS, but also JavaScript or jQuery (a compiled library of JavaScript).\nWebsites combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all controlled by the browser. For example, if you use Google Chrome or Firefox, the browser translates all of the code in a manner for you to see and interact with, such as fonts, colors, drop-down menus, sliders, forms, etc. In order for all of this to work, though, something has to support the front-end; here the backend comes into play.\nBack-end\nIn a previous blog, we talked about how web programmers are concerned with launching websites, updates, and maintenance, among other things.

The back-end has three parts to it: server, application, and database.\nTo better explain, let\u2019s use the example of a customer trying to purchase a plane ticket using a website. Everything that the customer sees on the webpage is the front-end. However, once the customer enters all of their information (ie. their name, billing address, destination, etc), the web application stores the information in a database that was created previously on the server where the website is calling for information.\nThe web application creates, deletes, changes, renames, etc items in the database. For example, when a customer purchases a ticket, that creates an item in the database, but when they change their order or they wish to cancel, they change the item in the database.\nA server, in the simplest form, is a computer accessed remotely that runs software to fulfill requests from clients. In our example, the server the customer\u2019s browser is communicating with is where the database is stored and modified.\nWhen a customer wants to buy a ticket, the backend operation web application communicates with the server to make a change in a database stored on said server. Backend programmers use technologies like Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, and others to make this communication work smoothly, allowing the customer to purchase his or her ticket with ease.\nWhat\u2019s your preference?\nMany of these technologies relate to eachother. They all work together to make something work. Some developers can program for both front-end and back-end. However, it takes much more time to design while programming the back-end. It all depends on the project and what technologies and skills are needed where.\nWhich do you prefer? Does front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interest you more? Or do you see yourself as a back-end champion tackling technologies like PHP, Python, and Ruby? Whichever your choice, you can learn how to use these programming languages in Codeup. Our classes focus on Java and client-side JavaScript; This leaves room for our graduates to decide whether they would like to pursue front-end or back-end development.\nFor the next blog, we will talk about being a full stack developer and what that entails.\nInterested in learning in becoming a software developer?

One thing became very clear: colleges are doing a terrible job producing programmers.\nHere\u2019s what we found out:\nProgramming isn\u2019t fun \u00a0\nUndergrad computer science has changed little since the late 1990s when I was in school. One thing that hasn\u2019t changed is the high weed-out rate of students in CS. According to a study out of the Helsinki University of Technology, Finland, between 30 and 50% of CS majors drop out and switch to other majors during their first intro to CS course. The number one reason: lack of motivation. Colleges don\u2019t make CS fun, and that\u2019s a tragedy.\nCollege takes a long time\nMany people went back to school hoping to become developers. \u00a0In the case of an associate\u2019s program, it take 2 years or more. A classic college education is four years. You do not want to know about how much it costs (click here to find out).\nCollege includes things that aren\u2019t necessary to do a programming job\nDoes one really need a full liberal arts degree with electives to be employable? As the recent crops of college graduates have demonstrated, a college degree doesn\u2019t mean a future.\nLectures are a terrible way to learn coding\nThink of programming like learning a new spoken language. Is that best done sitting in classroom or being on the streets of a foreign country talking with the locals? The same thing goes for college where the lecture format still dominates.\nColleges teach what they can sell\nColleges sell degrees, not futures. \u00a0If a college had to guarantee a future to its graduates, would they offer so many degrees that produce people with no useful skills?\nProfessors (often) teach what interests them\nFor those of us who took a class from a research professor, we discovered quickly that our semester long class would be 20% quickly going through course materials and an 80% deep dive on the professor\u2019s personal research interests. It\u2019s great that the professor thinks that pandas are a majestic animal, but the class is Biology, not endangered species 101.\nCollege is slow to keep up\nIn tech, things move incredibly fast. Here\u2019s the problem with college development: departments start planning their offerings several years before the student is taught the information. By that time, it\u2019s likely the real world has changed so much that the student is being taught information from 3 or 4 years ago. In visiting some CS departments, I have heard from students that their professors were teaching languages that went out of real-world usage decades ago.\nSo, STEM education is broken. Schools need to align their interests with those of the students. Schools need to make tech accessible. Schools need to put students first, rather than treat them as customers. Students should finish with a future and not a mountain of debt. And so on. Things need to change.\nWe think there\u2019s a better answer, and we\u2019ve designed it. If schools sold you an education but not a future, we have the answer. Applications are open at Codeup.com.\n"}, {"title": "Why Do Lawyers Get Paid the Big Money? - Codeup", "content": "\nLawyers are compensated extremely well for the work that they do, but why is their pay so high, $250 per hour and beyond?\nThree reasons: 1) They have a skill with limited supply of people that can do it, 2) the difference between a mediocre and good lawyer is really apparent, and 3) they work on really important stuff (i.e., when people hire a lawyer, the job needs to be done right).\nSound familiar? This why programmers get paid so well, too.\n1) Limited supply of people\nEven in our very own San Antonio, TX, there just are not enough programmers to meet the demand that employers have. They often have to look elsewhere in order to find people to fulfill their technology needs. A lot of programmers who are also homegrown here in San Antonio leave the city in order to find jobs elsewhere because they are not aware of all of the opportunity that lies here. \u00a0The United States is even giving foreign people with computer science backgrounds work visas to live in the US and offer their skills. Looking for a career in which you will always be needed? This is it.\n2) The difference between good and bad are apparent\nAny lawyer that tells you that a case is \u201ca slam dunk\u201d is a bad lawyer. Any lawyer that stumbles and fumbles through the law as if he or she were riding a unicycle on a rocky road is an awful lawyer. Any programmer that builds apps full of bugs and that crash every time you open them and calls it a finished product is a bad programmer. It is easy to tell the difference between something that is good and something that is awful, especially with computer programming. You know something is good when the program is doing what it is meant to do without issues. It\u00a0feels flawless, which means a lot of hard work went into building it. However, like the examples above, bad lawyers and programming are quite apparent. Would you use Facebook as much if it worked like MySpace when MySpace was popular? Chances are you would not.\n3) They work on important things\nLook at your smartphone or tablet and think about all of the apps you use on a daily basis. Then, look at your laptop or desktop computer and think about all of the things you use those for. Now, look at your job and all of the software and technology necessary to keep you afloat, aware, and productive. Chances are that you rely heavily on technology on a day-to-day basis, and a lot of it is important for our lives, personally and professionally. Computer programmers, among others, are the people behind a lot of the things we take for granted every day. They work on important things, and they need to be paid well for it. You would not want to pay as little as possible for an architect to design your family\u2019s home; why would you want a computer programmer to be paid very little to make your life much more frustrating with buggy and incomplete software?\nThese are just three simple reasons why computer programmers, like lawyers, get paid a lot of money. It\u2019s really about what they do and who they do it for.\nRight now is the best time to learn how to become a computer programmer and start getting paid well for doing important things. If you\u2019d like to learn more about how you can get the most out this profession, apply for Codeup and let\u2019s talk!\n"}, {"title": "The College Financing Scam and How We're Doing Things Differently - Codeup", "content": "\nHere\u2019s the dirty secret of private college \u201cfinancing\u201d and how it really works. Private colleges first set a ridiculously high list price. Here\u2019s my alma mater\u00a0Lafayette College as an example. Their all-in cost per year now is $57,000 (food not included, sorry).\nHere\u2019s the secret: most everyone doesn\u2019t pay nearly that much. They get \u201cfinancial aid.\u201d The financial aid office studies each family\u2019s finances, tax returns, and background and then uses a formula to determine financial aid and grants. In other words, they look to see the maximum that a family can afford and charge that amount.\nTo repeat: colleges study how much you can possibly afford and then set the price for you. This is like a car dealer looking at your tax return and deciding how much you should pay for a car. That\u2019s wrong.\nOf course, the department that looks at financial aid is a cost center for the school. Colleges have to hire financial aid assistants, governmental compliance managers, debt collectors, managers to manage the managers, and so on. Therefore, tuition has to be higher to pay for more staff to handle the amount of loans, aid, and financing that must be arranged. It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\nFor most\u00a0colleges, the price that you pay is not only for the cost of your classes. You pay for everything else that the college has to offer, even if you do not use all of their services, such as their sports teams, gyms, luxury dormitories, etc. The rising cost of college is also affected by administrators with\u00a0bloated salaries\u00a0and\u00a0inefficient spending, but not teacher salaries.\u00a0For example, 42 college presidents\u00a0made over $1\u00a0million in compensation in 2012. Additionally, many universities are having to spend millions on trying to attract more students to apply because they have to compete for students on a\u00a0global scale.\nThe result of this process is that the parents and students are forced to take out student loans that will take decades to pay off. We know tons of people who are saddled with student debt in their late 30s and early 40s.\nYoung people graduate with tons of debt and no guarantee of a future. Is that the way education should work? We think that\u2019s garbage.\nPeople ask if they can use government grants, conventional student loans, GI Bills, and other public or private financing sources. We say no because we don\u2019t want to punish our students because the higher education system is fundamentally broken. If we join other educational institutions exploiting students and government funding, we\u2019ll slowly become the bureaucratic mess they have become. Instead, we want to spend our time working to prepare our students.\nWe think that higher-education needs a complete rethinking. Education should be tied to a future, not to a slip of paper. If an educational program wins while students lose, that is a failed institution and system.\nWith Codeup, you get what you pay for. We put our money where our mouth is. We do not ask for government handouts. We do not saddle students with any debt until we get them a future. You win, we win. You lose, we lose.\nStudents first, always, and that is how it should be.\n"}, {"title": "Why People Can't Learn Programming on Their Own - Codeup", "content": "\nWhile developing Codeup, we interviewed dozens of people who attempted to\u00a0learn programming\u00a0on their own. We wanted to delve into their experience to uncover lessons learned. \u00a0We discovered the self-taught method was done with good intentions but the result was unfortunately failure. Here are some of the reasons it didn\u2019t work out.\n1. \u00a0Beginning point\nOur interviewees really didn\u2019t know where to start. The topic of technology is huge, so determining a beginning point was difficult. Most people don\u2019t know what to learn first. One person told us she started with Java, a popular programming language. Although it\u2019s widely used, it\u2019s difficult to learn. I know because I wrote four books on it.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0Online resources suck\nComputers and online lessons stink at teaching anything complex. If you can\u2019t understand a topic, your only option for clarification is to have the online resource explain it to you again the exact same way. That doesn\u2019t work at advancing your knowledge. What is beneficial to your learning is having a live instructor understand your thought process so that he/she can customize the instruction for you. In programming, concepts build on one another. For each concept you learn, the preceding topic must be understood. If you\u2019re missing a core concept, you won\u2019t understand the next one.\n3. \u00a0Lack of focus\nComputer programming is intense. We discovered that people lose their focus because the topic is not easily absorbed. It takes time to learn and practice programming, a big investment that some are not willing to make long-term. Some think they can learn it within a weekend or at night, but that approach only sets them up for failure. Another reason people lose their focus is because life gets in the way.\n4. \u00a0Single minded\nOne is a lonely number when you\u2019re learning on your own. Lessons learned in solitude are not beneficial because there is only one perspective \u2014 yours. \u00a0People get more out of instruction when they learn in groups \u2013 the one thing the current education system gets right. \u00a0Peers within groups motivate others to perform better. \u00a0Having individuals as part of a group instantly creates a community where everyone is traveling the same journey.\n5. \u00a0Reasons to learn\nFor most people, learning programming had no clear endpoint. They had difficulty envisioning life after the lesson. Do I really get a job? Am I building something meaningful? Having invested a lot of time and energy on programming, people started to question \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d\nThe Codeup model addresses these issues in a learning system we\u2019ve developed into a single, intense 9-week boot camp with live instructors. Students finish with a Hiring Day where they demonstrate a live, production ready application to show prospective employers.\nWe\u00a0want to teach you about programming, so you can put this skill to work to improve your life and those of others. Are you ready to step into the future?\n"}]
