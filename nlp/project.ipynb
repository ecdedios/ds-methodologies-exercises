We\\'d love for you to try to plug in data from your city.\\nSee what the live Austin demo lookes like.\\nWhat is the CitySDK?\\nCitySDK is a toolbox for civic innovators to connect local and national public data developed by the US Census Department. You should explore their wonderful guides and documentation.\\n\\nCitySDK\\nCitySDK Guides\\nCitySDK Code Examples\\n\\nRequests\\nHere is an example of the request we are making for demographic data in Austin, Texas (Travis County):\\nvar sdk = new CitySDK();\\nvar censusModule = sdk.modules.census;\\ncensusModule.enable(config.citySDK_token);\\n\\nvar request = {\\n  \"lat\": config.city_lat,\\n  \"lng\": config.city_lng,\\n  \"level\": \"county\",\\n  \"sublevel\": \"true\",\\n  \"api\" : \"acs5\",\\n  \"variables\": [\\n    \"population\",  // Total Population\\n    \"income\",  // Median Income\\n    \"poverty_family\",  // Number of Families Below Poverty\\n    \"poverty\",  // Number of x Below Poverty\\n    \"B01001_003E\",  // Male:!!Under 5 years\\n    \"B01001_004E\",  // Male:!!5 to 9 years\\n    \"B01001_005E\",  // Male:!!10 to 14 years\\n    \"B01001_006E\",  // Male:!!15 to 17 years\\n    \"B01001_027E\",  // Female:!!Under 5 years\\n    \"B01001_028E\",  // Female:!!5 to 9 years\\n    \"B01001_029E\",  // Female:!!10 to 14 years\\n    \"B01001_030E\",  // Female:!!15 to 17 years\\n    \"C27012_001E\",  // Total Health Insurance Coverage Status and Type by Work Experience by Age\\n  ]\\n};\\n\\ncensusModule.GEORequest(request, function callback(response) {\\n   // Do stuff\\n});\\nThis cURL command would make the same type of request:\\n$ curl \\'http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs5?get=NAME,B01003_001E,B19013_001E,B17012_002E,B17001_002E,B01001_003E,B01001_004E,B01001_005E,B01001_006E,B01001_027E,B01001_028E,B01001_029E,B01001_030E,C27012_001E&for=tract:*&in=county:453+state:48&key=YOUR_TOKEN\\'\\n\\nGET http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs5\\n    get=NAME,B01003_001E,B19013_001E,B17012_002E,B17001_002E,B01001_003E,B01001_004E,B01001_005E,B01001_006E,B01001_027E,B01001_028E,B01001_029E,B01001_030E,C27012_001E\\n    for=tract:*\\n    in=county:453+state:48\\n    key=YOUR_TOKEN\\nForking this repo\\n1. Getting Started\\nFind park data: The first thing you should do is look for park data from your city. Many cities and counties have a data portal. In Austin, we found raw park GIS data through the City\\'s Socrata Open Data Portal.\\nOften times, this data will be in a format best for analysis with desktop GIS software. For this web map, the ideal data type is geojson. But if it is in Shapefile format, that is ok too. But we\\'ll worry about converting the file type later. Check out this blog post to learn why .geojson is nice and to learn how to convert data into geojson.\\nFork the repo: Did you find a .geojson, .json, .shp (Shapefile), or .kml file with park polygons? Awesome. We\\'ll make sure to convert that data into the best format in a later step. Now, you should go ahead and fork this repo to your own Github account. Once you\\'ve forked the repo and cloned it down from your own Github repo to your local machine, go ahead and follow the steps below...\\nIf you couldn\\'t find some park data, but you still want to play along. Try using this data from Oakland.\\n2. Running Code Locally\\n1. npm is required\\nnpm is Node\\'s package manager. You can install Node at their site or with a command like brew install node if you use Homebrew.\\n2. webpack is required\\nwebpack is used to bundle assets\\n$ npm install -g webpack\\n\\n3. install npm dependencies\\nInstall the npm dependencies:\\n$ npm install\\n\\n4. run the build system && development server\\nTo bundle assets, run the local server and see the app in your browser:\\n$ npm start\\n\\nNPM will serve the app at http://localhost:8080.\\n3. Import you own park data\\nBack in Step 1, we wanted to make sure you could find park data from your city. Now\\'s the time to import it into the app. We save our GIS file into a directory called /data. See that directory here on Github. Now that your raw data is imported, its time to convert your data to .geojson (if its not already). I suggest you follow the instructions in this blog if you haven\\'t used ogr2ogr or coverted Shapefiles to geojson before. Last step here, rename your file to parks.geojson. This is what the code is expecting that park layer to be called. You\\'ll need to either delete or rename the Austin park layer that came down with the repo.\\n4. Config and customize the app to your city\\nUpdate the config file. Go into the config file and update things like the coordinates of your city and your own CitySDK token (which you should request here).\\nBuild new features. Add new features. The main javascript code live in the js/app.js file\\nAustin Data Sources\\n\\nCity of Austin, Parks and Recreation Department (PARD) Data\\n\\nBasic Park Feature Layer via ArcGIS Server\\n\\nAlso available on data.austintexas.gov\\nThis data is used across the app to produce park shapes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGlobal Data Sources\\n\\nOpen Street Map Park Data:\\n\\nWe use the Overpass API via the \"query-overpass\" plugin to extract data. Here\\'s the commit that added OSM data if you\\'re curious how.\\n\\n\\nCensus.gov Data\\n\\nCitySDK API\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlicense\\nReleased to the public domain under the Unlicense by Open Austin, 2015.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

You need to know:\\nWho is paying them?\\nHow are they voting as a result?\\nBy linking lawmakers’ campaign finance records to their voting records, taxpayers can track the influence of money in the Texas political process.\\nIn this era of political polarization and biased news sources, people are craving information and hard facts. INFLUENCE TX empowers citizens to do their own research and figure who their politicians are really serving.\\nWe invite all those who participate in INFLUENCE TX to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone, while maintaining a robust sense of humor.

This is the only product people can use to find out who paid off their Texas state politicians and how they voted as a result.\\nFor citizens interested in Texas state government who need an unbiased source they can use to determine what their politicians are really doing.\\nThis product is a mobile-first responsive web app (with an advanced-user desktop version planned for future releases) that puts campaign finance and voting records in a usable format so citizens can see how money is influencing the political process\\nUnlike product like FollowTheMoney.org, which offers no explanation of (1) where they got their data (2) how “fresh” it is (3) matching methodology of associating certain monetary donations with certain industry segments, and also does not offer voting records\\nManifesto\\nThree ITX team members are in Mozilla Open Leaders Training Program. The principles that guide the INFLUENCE TX mission to provide information that creates transparency in government are those of The Mozilla Manifesto. Principle No. 10 is particularly relevant: “Magnifying the public benefit aspects of the Internet is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.”\\n\\nINFLUENCE TX a nonpartisan, open source project devoted to developing a research tool that empowers citizens with varying degrees of technical skill to be their own reporters -- they don’t have to wait for a biased gatekeeper to give them the news.\\nINFLUENCE TX will never advocate for or affiliate itself with a political party.\\nINFLUENCE TX is an inclusive organization that welcomes people of all political persuasions -- including Democrats, Republicans, and independents.\\nWe advocate for curiosity over judgment. We are dedicated to sound research. In so doing, we are courageous and willing to have our own views and opinions challenged by facts and new ways of looking at the world. We are willing to be surprised.\\nWe seek greater understanding of those around us.\\nWe pledge to value people as human beings and to foster an atmosphere of kindness, cooperation, and understanding.\\nA primary goal of INFLUENCE TX is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.\\n\\nReason\\nVoting drives are nice, but getting uninformed people to cast ballots is not helping anyone. Voters need a quick, user-friendly way to tell who a politician really is.\\nWho has the time to search for hours and hours through newspapers and online articles in the (possibly vain) hope of finding unbiased information on each and every candidate?\\nVoters need to know:\\n\\nwhose money has the potential to influence a politician (campaign finance records).\\nhow the politician voted (voting records).\\n\\nBy putting these two pieces of information together in a succinct mobile platform, we can turn uninformed voters into informed voters.\\nContributing\\nAll participants should read the Influence Texas Code of Conduct prior to engaging with the team and contributing on the product.\\n\\nView the work needed for our upcoming milestone.\\nDevelopment\\nFor instructions on getting started with development, go to src/README.rst.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

This project is about studying that content so we can make the portal better.\\nStatus\\n\\nWe\\'re currently developing the second release of the Portal Analyzer; previous releases can be found on this page.\\nCurrent project goals\\nWrite code that grabs specific pieces of information from Austin\\'s public data portal and rearranges it into a format that\\'s useful for analysis.\\nNext goals include automated publishing to the City\\'s data portal, so everyone can access and analyze this data.\\nWhy we\\'re doing this\\nThere are many ways to explore data quality. Improving data quality is a job that\\'s never done.\\nCurrent business needs/issues to explore include:\\nIdentifiers... How often are departments using unique identifiers for City assets? What is the nature of those identifiers? Where might we benefit from using common identifiers?\\nRedundancy... How often are departments publishing the same information within their datasets? Are there any departments publishing about the same topics who might want to collaborate?\\nAccessibility... Are we using multiple resources to publish the same information repeatedly for different time periods? (Not ideal for API consumers.) What column labels and descriptions don\\'t match up with their values, and could perhaps use some tuning? How often are schemas changing? Are these changes good or bad for data consumers?\\nTable grain... How often are we publishing aggregate information (subtotals and totals) when we could be publishing atomic data? This one is huge!\\nQuick Start Guide\\nInstallation and Use\\nRun the following commands from a terminal:\\ngit clone https://github.com/open-austin/data-portal-analysis.git\\ncd data-portal-analysis\\n\\nOptional steps:\\n\\nIf you will be usng virtualenv, create an environment and activate it before continuing.\\nTo run the most recent stable release, see the note about branches below.\\n\\nThis command will install dependencies:\\npip install -r requirements.txt\\n\\nAfter pip is finished, run the test suite with:\\nnosetests -v\\n\\nFinally, use the folowing command to run the analyzer in online mode; you can replace results.csv with a filename of your choice:\\n./PortalAnalyzer.py results.csv\\n\\nNote: PortalAnalyzer.py also creates a file called portal_analyzer.log that can be used for troubleshooting. Passing either -v or --verbose on the command line will result in a more detailed logfile. Use --help for a complete list of options.\\nRegarding branches\\nThe master branch always contains stable code that passes the same tests as the most recent release, but it may have patches that were not included in that release. The default branch, develop, contains code that is still being tested and should not be used \"in production.\"\\nThe following command can be used to track and checkout master:\\ngit checkout -b master origin/master\\n\\nTo switch back to the development branch, use git checkout develop.\\nDocumentation\\n\\nHow to contribute\\nThe easiest way for Python developers to contribute is by fixing problems detected by QuantifiedCode, because the \"learn to fix\" link provides guidelines for resolving each issue. Click on the badge below to get started.\\n\\nDevelopers can also help by creating enhancements and new features; visit the project board on waffle.io to get an overview of development status.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to contribute but you\\'re not sure how to start, comment on the meta-issue for the current release and one of the project maintainers will be happy to help.\\nContributing terms\\nWhen you contribute to this project, you are sharing and/or creating content.

Our team includes developers, designers, a publisher, a curriculum writer and educators from Open Austin, the Austin Monitor, and Austin ISD.\\nWe are interested in the health of our civic fabric and we are excited about the potential for youth inclusion in the decision making process of local government.\\nThanks for coming here to learn more!\\nProject Description\\nBudget Party was built to help people understand and augment a city budget for Austin. It is an interactive app that is best used in context of a \"Budget Party\" event.\\nHistorically, Budget party events have 4 parts:\\n\\nA budget Overview. A quick presentation is given to people that primes them on the city budget, specifically the parts that citizens can influence.\\nBudget Party App Use. People get into small teams with neighbors to go through the app and allocate funds to different departments.\\nJudging A selection of people with real city budgeting experience judge the submitted budgets and choose a winner based on the night’s criteria.\\nPanel Discussion Once judging is done there is an open discussion on budgeting based on the submitted budgets, feasibility, and real world budgeting experience from the panelist/judges.\\n\\nRead about the history of Budget Party which includes information on the inception of the project and our Mozilla Grant funding.\\nWhat\\'s Next\\nThe Budget Party team is currently on pause. Budget season in Austin is over for 2017 but we are working to evaluate how best to move forward with the project to be ready for the 2018 budget season.\\nGot an idea? Reach out to the team! Community feedback is valuable in helping us evaluate our next steps. How can we make Budget Party more valuable for you?\\nContributing\\nThis project has received contributions from some wonderful volunteers. We would love to add your name to the list below. Over the course of this project, we have opportunities to help with design, development, QA & testing, writing, and more. To contribute, you can:\\n\\nReport a bug or request a feature by opening a new issue.\\nReview open issues and leave a comment if you\\'d like to help or if you need more information.\\n\\nFor more information on how to get invovled check out CONTRIBUTING.md.\\nAlso view our list of contributors.\\nDev Getting started\\nThis project has a dependency on Node and npm.

The feeder is not part of the Rails application (this repository) - instead, the Rails app has an API that provides access to update our database of missing animals, and external scripts are handling the nasty business of scraping external sources. The current Pet Harbor feeder is a Ruby script using soda to access the data.\\nNotifications are being sent to subscribers via email and text message for any new animals logged on AAC.\\nInstallation\\nNOTE: We temporarily discourage the use of vagrant for this project - it's too slow to be feasible.\\nLocal\\n\\nMake sure you have Ruby 2.1.3 installed (RVM or rubyenv make this easy)\\nMake sure you have Bundler installed\\n$ git clone git@github.com:open-austin/pet-finder.git\\n$ bundle install\\n$ rake db:migrate\\n$ rails server\\nVisit localhost:3000 to view the site in the browser.\\n\\nVagrant\\n\\n\\nMake sure you have VirtualBox installed.\\n\\n\\nMake sure you have vagrant installed.\\n\\n\\n$ git clone git@github.com:open-austin/pet-finder.git\\n\\n\\n$ vagrant up\\n\\n\\nNote that you will likely have to enter your password at some point to enable NFS - this is bypassable by sourceing the following from vagrant's docs:\\n  Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD = /usr/bin/tee -a /etc/exports\\n  Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_NFSD = /sbin/nfsd restart\\n  Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE = /usr/bin/sed -E -e /*/ d -ibak /etc/exports\\n  %admin ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD, VAGRANT_NFSD, VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVisit localhost:3000 to view the site in the browser.\\n\\n\\nConfiguration\\nWe are using Figaro to manage secret configuration settings - all this means for you is that you should create an application.yml file in config/ that looks like the following:\\nGMAIL_USERNAME: [working gmail address]\\nGMAIL_PASSWORD: [working gmail password]\\n\\nhttp_username: username\\nhttp_password: password\\n\\naws_key: [request a key]\\naws_secret: [request a secret]\\ns3_bucket: pet-alert-dev\\n\\nplivo_auth_id: auth-id\\nplivo_auth_token: auth-token\\nplivo_number: 1231231234\\n\\nEmail services\\nAll emails are sent from a background service called Sidekiq that will be installed alongside the rest of the gems - however, Sidekiq requires redis in order to function properly.\\n\\nInstall redis\\n$ redis-server\\n$ bundle exec sidekiq -q notifier -q default\\n\\nSMS services\\nWe are using Plivo to send SMS messages - if you need to test this locally, you will need to request an auth id and token from us. Generally, this shouldn't be necessary - the message sending part of the app is taken care of.\\nContributing\\nTo contribute, fork this repo and submit pull requests for merges. All updates should have accompanying tests (we use RSpec), and should ensure that all existing tests are passing. We are still establishing coding standards and practices, so do your best to contribute code that is as consistent as possible with things now.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

We want to help citizen, government, and nonprofit stakeholders solve problems.\\nOpen Austin is an open source organization. We make our projects freely and openly available. GitHub is where we collaborate. There are some really handy tools here, including a feature called Issues. This is where we can break projects into manageable problems for collaborators to solve together.\\nWe hope you find what you\\'re looking for, but if you need help, you can email us here!\\nThanks for co-creating with us!\\nHow To Propose or Discuss Project Ideas\\nGitHub Issues work just like any other commenting system on the Internet.\\nFirst, you\\'ll need to create an account.\\nThen you have two options:\\nComment on an existing idea (a.k.a. \"issue\")\\nScroll through the issues list first to see if anyone\\'s already thinking the same way! If you see an idea that catches your eye, click on it, read the discussion, and then add your thoughts to the bottom of the discussion thread. If you see the Needs Leadership label, bring it up at a hack night, and if you\\'re up for it you can take the lead on it!\\nOr, create a new idea.\\nIf you don\\'t see the idea you have in mind, add a new one. You\\'ll need a title and description. Someone from the Open Austin Core Team will respond, likely with some questions or feedback, and assign you to the issue to indicate you are leading the effort.\\nHere\\'s a quick video intro on using Github Issues for discussion.\\nNext Steps\\n\\n\\nPlease make a status update to your issues at least once a month to keep others informed. If we don\\'t hear from you after some time, we might assume you\\'ve moved on and will ask others to take the lead.\\n\\n\\nIf nobody\\'s talking yet, it might be that your idea needs some more fleshing out. We highly recommend thinking through the Civic Tech Canvas as a next step!\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to be the champion on this project, you should let one of our project leads know. GitHub is the platform we\\'re using to collect and vet ideas and then convert them into active projects. Once a project becomes active, we\\'ll help you set up a repository on the Open Austin GitHub organization so you can start scoping and collaborating. We\\'ll continue to use the Issues feature on your own project repo to flag obstacles, opportunities, and answer questions about that specific project. We will then add the project repo link to your idea issue and close it, indicating your graduation from idea to an active project.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The Mission:FakeNews team will develop a web app version of the Kraken the Code Web Literacy Exercise.\\nLesson #2: Rewriting History\\nThe goal of Lesson 2 is to help students better understand how fake new is produced and how it is spread. Students will have the opportunity to deconstruct fake news and to explore the techniques people use to create fake news, and the consequences of those techniques.\\nLesson #3: Run the Presses\\nThe goal of the Lesson 3 is to put students in the editor’s chair and give them a chance to make decisions common in news organizations, and to experience the consequences of those decisions. With this lesson, students will gain a deeper understanding of how fake news fits in a broader news and information ecosystem.\\nContact\\n\\nAshley Fisher, Austin Monitor\\nSarah Morris, Nucleus Learning Network\\nMateo Clarke, Open Austin & Civic Party Software\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Fork this repo and open a pull request.\\nThis repo consists of three parts:\\n\\nGuidelines\\nExamples of projects that do a good job making themselves easy to fork\\nREADME Template\\n\\nGuidelines\\nSimplify your app as much as possible\\n\\nReduce the number of dependencies\\n\\nDo you really need mongo and memcached?\\nDo you even need a server?\\nCan your app just be static HTML + JS files hosted on GitHub Pages?\\n\\n\\nUse simple, easy-to-deploy technology\\n\\nTools like Travis CI make deployment public. Anybody can look at the build history and figure out how things are built.\\n\\n\\nDeploy-This buttons\\n\\nDeploy to Heroku button\\n\\n\\n\\nPut yourself in your forker’s shoes\\n\\nInline documentation, explain your thinking.\\nUser Context. Anything to better understand the intended users, uses, usage.\\n\\nLicenses and Copyright\\n\\n Choose a license and add it to your repo. ChooseALicense.com can help you choose a license. We recommend dedicating your work to the public domain. Why? The MIT, GPL, and other popular licenses don\\'t answer the question of copyright.\\n Don\\'t put copyright 2015 John, Jane, Bob, etc. on every page (or even anywhere in the app). As somebody forking the repo, I don\\'t want to put your name on every page. Will you be offended that I\\'m removing yourname?\\n\\nAdmit your mistakes\\n\\n Are you unhappy with the architecture or the code of your app? Say so in the README or an issue (and explain why). People trying to fork your app may encounter some of these same problems and have solutions. Or they may just give up.\\n\\nTalk about your data\\n\\n What is the minimum amount of data needed to get the project running?\\n List all the data the app uses, where it comes from, and how it is used.\\n Sample data, please.\\n Tests and test data, if you used them.\\n\\nREADME.md\\nSee the README-template.md.\\n\\n Brief description of what the project does and why it exists. Explain why would someone else care.\\n Include screenshots of the project so people can see the project in action without figuring out how to use it.\\n Include a link to the project.\\n Specify a maintainer.\\n\\nINSTALL.md\\nBy default, include installation instructions in the README. Consider moving the instructions to a INSTALL.md if the instructions are very long and distract from the rest of the README.\\n\\n Use your languages package management tools. Avoid asking people to install them by hand. Be sure to use very specific version numbers (6.6.6 is much better than just 6).\\n\\nPython: requirements.txt\\nJavaScript: package.json\\nRuby: Gemfile\\nGo:  (Check in your dependencies, I guess)\\n\\n\\n List dependencies that have to be manually installed. Link to useful guides on setting them up. Examples include Postgres, ...\\n Test your installation and deployment instructions on a clean machine.\\n CHANGELOG.md\\n\"It is a good idea to keep a changelog. http://keepachangelog.com (is a project on GitHub). \"\\n\\nSee https://github.com/cfpb/qu and https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-explorer\\nSome Inspiration: http://keepachangelog.com/\\n\\n\\n\\nBe easy to contact\\n\\nAnswer/use GitHub issues\\nAdd an email to the README, or add emails to your GitHub profile\\nSpecify a maintainer, and make sure the maintainer has an easy to find email\\nIf your brigade or project has a Slack channel, add a link to it.\\n\\nCode Style\\n\\nFormat code consistently and follow a popular styleguide.\\n\\nJavaScript\\n\\nJS Standard Style\\nAirbnb JavaScript Style Guide\\nESLint\\n\\n\\nPython\\n\\nPEP8\\npyflakes\\n\\n\\nGo\\n\\ngofmt\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRepo Metadata\\n\\n\\n Fill out the Description on GitHub\\n Fill out the URL on GitHub\\n\\nConfiguration\\n\\n Keep your city specific configuration in one file\\n\\nFor example, if your app has a map with some initial coordinates, store those initial coordinates in a config file instead of making them difficult to find.\\n\\n\\n Move other hard-coded values to a settings file.\\n\\nExamples\\nSome apps that have been easy to fork:\\n\\nCutePetsBot - Forked over 40 times.

The annual appraisal roll consists of valuations of every parcel in the county, and includes details about the age and square footage of property improvements, the size and value of lots, jurisdictional taxing authorities, and much more.\\nWe are asking TCAD to make the data available in an open, usable format. Key issues with the current data delivery process are as follows:\\n\\n\\nTo obtain the appraisal roll data citizens must pay $80 per appraisal year. Electronic records are available dating back to 2007.\\n\\n\\nThe data are delivered to citizens in an MS database. This is an arcane, proprietary format that requires special software to view.\\n\\n\\nTCAD's own documentation explicitly states that some of the data are not available at all (even with purchase), due to the limitations of the MS Access format.\\n\\n\\nOther entities (including the City of Austin) have managed to obtain copies of the data in a format other than MS Access, yet the TCAD records office insists that the data are exclusively available in the MS Access format.\\n\\n\\nNeighboring appraisal districts have managed to provide this data for free, in an open format. For example, WCAD: http://www.wcad.org/public-data/downloads?id=343\\u2028\\n\\n\\nWe (Open Austin) have proposed a few solutions:\\n\\n\\nPublish the appraisal roll data on our own website for the public to download.\\n\\n\\nTCAD could partner with the City of Austin to have the data published on the city’s open data portal. I am a City of Austin employee and would be happy to connect TCAD staff with the City’s Open Data Team.\\n\\n\\nWe communicated these issues to TCAD Board of Directors chairperson Dick Lavine and the Chief Appraiser's executive assistant on April 10, 2017. Although Dick Lavine has expressed an interest in working with us, we have so far been unable to set up a follow-up meeting or get any response from the Chief Appraiser.\\nThe obvious next step is to attend a TCAD board meeting, but unfortunately these take place monthly on a weekday in an inaccessible part of town. Another approach would be to raise money to buy all the data, reformat it, and host it.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

The tricky part is what’s advisable to do in the name of your Brigade, which is technically a program of Code for America. As a nonprofit nonpartisan organization, the IRS puts certain rules in place that limit what we can and can’t do. We’ve listed a few below.\\nTo be clear, you can always speak or act on your own behalf, as long as you’re not representing your Brigade or Code for America.\\nThings that your Brigade can do:\\n\\nPublicly comment and educate the general public and elected officials on key issues of importance to your organization.\\nAdvocate for or against specific public policies by speaking out on decisions made by government agencies, executives, or courts.\\nCall, write, and meet with elected officials to support or oppose specific pieces of legislation.\\nSponsor and distribute nonpartisan voter guides.\\nSurvey candidates and report where they stand on the survey.\\n\\nThings that Brigades can not do:\\n\\nThey can not endorse or oppose candidates who are running for public office.\\nThey can not advise members of your brigade chapter or the public at large, directly or indirectly, to vote for or against specific candidates or political parties.\\nThey can not make financial contributions to candidates.\\nThey can not make in-kind contributions (including use of Brigade infrastructure) to political campaigns. (They can’t eat food meant for Brigade actions)\\nThey can not collect money on behalf of, or provide in-kind services, to a candidate.\\nThey can not create political action committees.\\nThey can not distribute or display campaign literature or partisan voter guides.\\n\\nTo reiterate; you can totally do these things personally, as long as you’re not acting as your Brigade or as Code for America when you do so.\\nWhen to say yes and when to say no\\nSome good questions to ask when faced with a question about whether to participate:\\n\\nWill this move my Brigade’s goals forward??  There’s nothing wrong with going “We’d love to march, but aren't equipped to organize a march. Are you connected with X org?” OR “We can’t lead it, but we’ll let our members know about it.”\\nIs my Brigade equipped to respond appropriately? Do you have the resources? Do you and your volunteers have time?\\nIs there another organization already doing this work? Can you partner with them or direct your members their way?\\nDoes this align with my Brigade’s values?\\nEvery Brigade is different. Your values should reflect your membership. It’s a judgement call that your leadership team has to make.\\n\\nAll systems go? \\n\\nRemember to keep your Brigade’s  ‘voice’ steady and loud\\nWhen we say voice, we mean the tone and demeanor of your Brigade’s outbound communications. Words matter. Stay Positive: Code for America has always been about taking an active role in government to use our talents in a positive way. We’re for America not against a person who just happens to hold high office.\\nThis might mean re-wording language for certain calls to action. “Save the data” vs “Stop the deletion of data”\\nThis will also help to avoid violating our 501(c)3 by not being against any particular candidate.\\nGovernment agencies are our partners\\nRemember, there is more than one level of government.\\nA fan of your city? Reiterate a desire to help.\\nThe greatest office in a democracy is that of the citizen.\\nPeople want to be involved; your Brigade gives them one of many paths where they can do that.\\nReiterate your Brigade values early and often\\n\\nYour Brigade values are what makes you, you. While you may not be able to use the Brigade twitter account to directly lobby - you can use it as an opportunity to say “This is who we are and this is what we value.” You can always switch to your personal accounts when you want to get more partisan or forceful.\\nWhat are good actions to take as Brigades? \\n\\nSaving open government data to the Internet Archive\\nBrigade members have expertise on open data\\nIt matches your mission\\nIt’s nonpartisan\\nPartner with organizations to elevate voices from the community on various topics that matter to your members, such as   encryption, SMS messaging, government 101, or other aspects of governing. Your members may have an interest in learning more about a current newsworthy topic. Invite a speaker to your hacknight to share their knowledge. Being a civic technologists means knowing both sides of the house.\\nKeep calm and continue hacking\\nYour Brigade already makes your city stronger. You provide a space for people to engage with each other and leverage their technology skills to help their community. Building an app that gives people information about a law or government service.\\n\\nWhen you need a different type of superhero \\nNot everyone can be Batman. In fact, everyone trying to be Batman never turns out well. When looking at our current political climate and the challenges facing our cities,  it’s obvious that we’re going to need the whole Justice League.\\nIf you get a call to action (or want to take actions) that doesn’t sync up with the Brigade mission here are some places where you can volunteer or refer others too.\\n\\nTake off the track jacket and pick up a clipboard\\nYes, you could run for office. We know you love your city and your country. At least consider it.\\nVolunteer for a campaign\\nJoin a politically active meetup\\nMarch and protest\\nCall your elected officials\\nContribute and volunteer for nonprofits doing good work\\n\\nAs we get real world examples, we'll add these to the list. As always, if you have any questions please email christopher@codeforamerica.org\\nThe Brigade Team & the National Advisory Council\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

It is the city’s duty to ensure a system that embraces automation, ease and sustainability.\\nActions\\n1) Creation of CTTC Working Group - The City’s Community Technology & Telecommunications Commission (CTTC) will form a working group to draft a formal recommendation for an open data ordinance for presentation to the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee of the City Council.\\nRecommendations\\n\\n\\nData is Machine Readable - This means releasing information in open formats (or “open standards”), in machine-readable formats, that are structured (or machine-processable) appropriately. Plainly, “open formats” refer to a rolling set of “open standards,” often defined by standards organizations, that store information in a way that can be accessed by proprietary or non-proprietary software means. These formats exist across an array of data types; a common example cited is CSV in lieu of XLS for spreadsheets (the former being accessible via a wider variety of software mechanisms than the latter). “Machine-readability” simply refers to a format that a computer can understand. For example, .PDF formats for documents are not an idea format for machine readability.\\n\\n\\nData Catalog - For an open data policy to have a strong foundation, you first need to know what data you have—and so does the public. Governments should conduct an inventory of existing data early in the process of open data policy development in order for the government and other stakeholders to be aware of the full potential dimensions of data release. While defining total information holdings may be a complex undertaking, governments should conduct as comprehensive a review of existing data information as possible, with the inclusion of information holdings that may benefit from becoming structured data themselves.\\n\\n\\nPrioritize and Release - The The new working group will prioritize based on the catalog for the next year’s goals. As part of the first year’s guarantees, we recommend that one high value data set, based on community input, to be released under the new accessible guidelines.\\n\\n\\nLicensed Free - The City of Austin shall license any data it publishes for free re-use to ensure clarity of copyright without legal responsibility or liability for publishing such data.\\n\\n\\nContracted products and services must adhere - To ensure that the public retains access to its data, provisions should added whenever possible to the existing procurement, contracting or planning processes requiring government contractors release government relevant information openly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The software can\\nbe used to generate reports for local filing, but does not support electronic filing locally.\\nThe state software allows import of contributions and expenditures. Our tool will be\\nmodeled around this import format. It is documented in the TX-CFA Import Guide:\\nhttp://www.ethics.state.tx.us/whatsnew/ImportGuide.pdf\\nDevelopment Status\\nThere is currently a prototype \"import engine\" that would load CSV files in a standard form\\ndefined by the TEC, save them in a database, and (if desired) produce the standard TEC forms as PDFs.\\nNow that we\\'ve got a workable data model and PDF rendering tool, we\\'d like to build a web-based app.\\nWhen complete, this will provide a complete solution for campaigns to file their financial reports,\\nand provide public transparency to funds in the political system.\\nThe import engine is written in ruby, and the web framework has been created in rails.\\nThey need to be merged.\\nInstallation Notes\\nThese instructions will help get the rails web framework installed. The import engine\\ncurrently lives in the dm-import-engine branch.\\ngit clone https://github.com/chip-rosenthal/tecfiler.git\\ncd tecfiler\\nbundle install\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy config/database_example.yml to database.yml and edit it for your preferred db.\\n\\n\\nCopy config/email_example.yml to email.yml and edit it for your email server settings.

You may encounter failures\\nif you try to run the entire \"spec\" suite.\\nYou can perform all tests in a single spec file with a command such as:\\nbundle exec rspec spec/models/contribution_spec.rb\\n\\nor a single test case by including a line number, such as:\\nbundle exec rspec spec/models/contribution_spec.rb:14\\n\\nAn in-memory database is used for test mode (RAILS_ENV=\"test\"). This speeds\\nup testing a bit. (But not enough, it still takes a painful amount of time\\nto bring up the Rails stack for testing.)\\nProduction Notes\\nBefore running in a production environment, be sure to update the secret token to a unique value:\\nrake secret\\n\\nEdit your config/initializers/secret_token.rb file to add the secret token:\\nTecfilerAr::Application.config.secret_token = \\'...some really long, random string...\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Getting Started\\nFind park data: The first thing you should do is look for park data from your city. Many cities and counties have a data portal. In Austin, we found raw park GIS data through the City\\'s Socrata Open Data Portal.\\nOften times, this data will be in a format best for analysis with desktop GIS software. For this web map, the ideal data type is geojson. But if it is in Shapefile format, that is ok too. But we\\'ll worry about converting the file type later. Check out this blog post to learn why .geojson is nice and to learn how to convert data into geojson.\\nFork the repo: Did you find a .geojson, .json, .shp (Shapefile), or .kml file with park polygons? Awesome. We\\'ll make sure to convert that data into the best format in a later step. Now, you should go ahead and fork this repo to your own Github account. Once you\\'ve forked the repo and cloned it down from your own Github repo to your local machine, go ahead and follow the steps below...\\nIf you couldn\\'t find some park data, but you still want to play along. Try using this data from Oakland.\\n2. Running Code Locally\\n1. npm is required\\nnpm is Node\\'s package manager. You can install Node at their site or with a command like brew install node if you use Homebrew.\\n2. webpack is required\\nwebpack is used to bundle assets\\n$ npm install -g webpack\\n\\n3. install npm dependencies\\nInstall the npm dependencies:\\n$ npm install\\n\\n4. run the build system && development server\\nTo bundle assets, run the local server and see the app in your browser:\\n$ npm start\\n\\nNPM will serve the app at http://localhost:8080.\\n3. Import you own park data\\nBack in Step 1, we wanted to make sure you could find park data from your city. Now\\'s the time to import it into the app. We save our GIS file into a directory called /data. See that directory here on Github. Now that your raw data is imported, its time to convert your data to .geojson (if its not already). I suggest you follow the instructions in this blog if you haven\\'t used ogr2ogr or coverted Shapefiles to geojson before. Last step here, rename your file to parks.geojson. This is what the code is expecting that park layer to be called. You\\'ll need to either delete or rename the Austin park layer that came down with the repo.\\n4. Config and customize the app to your city\\nUpdate the config file. Go into the config file and update things like the coordinates of your city and your own CitySDK token (which you should request here).\\nBuild new features. Add new features. The main javascript code live in the js/app.js file\\nAustin Data Sources\\n\\nCity of Austin, Parks and Recreation Department (PARD) Data\\n\\nBasic Park Feature Layer via ArcGIS Server\\n\\nAlso available on data.austintexas.gov\\nThis data is used across the app to produce park shapes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGlobal Data Sources\\n\\nOpen Street Map Park Data:\\n\\nWe use the Overpass API via the \"query-overpass\" plugin to extract data.

Checkout the live webapp at https://app.influencetexas.com/\\nFind more information at https://www.influencetexas.com/\\nWelcome & Project Summary\\nWelcome! We’re so glad you’ve found your way to INFLUENCE TX. This project was started at ATX Hack for Change June 2-4, 2017 by Amy M. Mosley, a former investigative reporter who was frustrated by a fruitless search for fact-based, unbiased sources for information during the toxic 2016 election cycle. In 2017 all ATX Hack for Change projects were aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This project falls under Goal 16: Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies.\\nThe premise is this, Politicians lie.\\nAnd usually, they do whatever they get paid to do. You need to know:\\nWho is paying them?\\nHow are they voting as a result?\\nBy linking lawmakers’ campaign finance records to their voting records, taxpayers can track the influence of money in the Texas political process.\\nIn this era of political polarization and biased news sources, people are craving information and hard facts. INFLUENCE TX empowers citizens to do their own research and figure who their politicians are really serving.\\nWe invite all those who participate in INFLUENCE TX to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone, while maintaining a robust sense of humor. Please read our CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and MANIFESTO before you proceed further.\\n\"The cornerstone of democracy rests on the foundation of an educated electorate.\" - Thomas Jefferson\\n\\nPurpose\\nInforming the Texas electorate.\\nProject Vision\\nINFLUENCE TX puts campaign finance records next to voting records so taxpayers can track the influence of money in the Texas state political process. This is the only product people can use to find out who paid off their Texas state politicians and how they voted as a result.\\nFor citizens interested in Texas state government who need an unbiased source they can use to determine what their politicians are really doing.\\nThis product is a mobile-first responsive web app (with an advanced-user desktop version planned for future releases) that puts campaign finance and voting records in a usable format so citizens can see how money is influencing the political process\\nUnlike product like FollowTheMoney.org, which offers no explanation of (1) where they got their data (2) how “fresh” it is (3) matching methodology of associating certain monetary donations with certain industry segments, and also does not offer voting records\\nManifesto\\nThree ITX team members are in Mozilla Open Leaders Training Program. The principles that guide the INFLUENCE TX mission to provide information that creates transparency in government are those of The Mozilla Manifesto. Principle No. 10 is particularly relevant: “Magnifying the public benefit aspects of the Internet is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.”\\n\\nINFLUENCE TX a nonpartisan, open source project devoted to developing a research tool that empowers citizens with varying degrees of technical skill to be their own reporters -- they don’t have to wait for a biased gatekeeper to give them the news.\\nINFLUENCE TX will never advocate for or affiliate itself with a political party.\\nINFLUENCE TX is an inclusive organization that welcomes people of all political persuasions -- including Democrats, Republicans, and independents.\\nWe advocate for curiosity over judgment. We are dedicated to sound research. In so doing, we are courageous and willing to have our own views and opinions challenged by facts and new ways of looking at the world. We are willing to be surprised.\\nWe seek greater understanding of those around us.\\nWe pledge to value people as human beings and to foster an atmosphere of kindness, cooperation, and understanding.\\nA primary goal of INFLUENCE TX is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.\\n\\nReason\\nVoting drives are nice, but getting uninformed people to cast ballots is not helping anyone. Voters need a quick, user-friendly way to tell who a politician really is.\\nWho has the time to search for hours and hours through newspapers and online articles in the (possibly vain) hope of finding unbiased information on each and every candidate?\\nVoters need to know:\\n\\nwhose money has the potential to influence a politician (campaign finance records).\\nhow the politician voted (voting records).\\n\\nBy putting these two pieces of information together in a succinct mobile platform, we can turn uninformed voters into informed voters.\\nContributing\\nAll participants should read the Influence Texas Code of Conduct prior to engaging with the team and contributing on the product.\\n\\nView the work needed for our upcoming milestone.\\nDevelopment\\nFor instructions on getting started with development, go to src/README.rst.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

This project is about studying that content so we can make the portal better.\\nStatus\\n\\nWe\\'re currently developing the second release of the Portal Analyzer; previous releases can be found on this page.\\nCurrent project goals\\nWrite code that grabs specific pieces of information from Austin\\'s public data portal and rearranges it into a format that\\'s useful for analysis.\\nNext goals include automated publishing to the City\\'s data portal, so everyone can access and analyze this data.\\nWhy we\\'re doing this\\nThere are many ways to explore data quality. Improving data quality is a job that\\'s never done.\\nCurrent business needs/issues to explore include:\\nIdentifiers... How often are departments using unique identifiers for City assets? What is the nature of those identifiers? Where might we benefit from using common identifiers?\\nRedundancy... How often are departments publishing the same information within their datasets? Are there any departments publishing about the same topics who might want to collaborate?\\nAccessibility... Are we using multiple resources to publish the same information repeatedly for different time periods? (Not ideal for API consumers.) What column labels and descriptions don\\'t match up with their values, and could perhaps use some tuning? How often are schemas changing? Are these changes good or bad for data consumers?\\nTable grain... How often are we publishing aggregate information (subtotals and totals) when we could be publishing atomic data? This one is huge!\\nQuick Start Guide\\nInstallation and Use\\nRun the following commands from a terminal:\\ngit clone https://github.com/open-austin/data-portal-analysis.git\\ncd data-portal-analysis\\n\\nOptional steps:\\n\\nIf you will be usng virtualenv, create an environment and activate it before continuing.\\nTo run the most recent stable release, see the note about branches below.\\n\\nThis command will install dependencies:\\npip install -r requirements.txt\\n\\nAfter pip is finished, run the test suite with:\\nnosetests -v\\n\\nFinally, use the folowing command to run the analyzer in online mode; you can replace results.csv with a filename of your choice:\\n./PortalAnalyzer.py results.csv\\n\\nNote: PortalAnalyzer.py also creates a file called portal_analyzer.log that can be used for troubleshooting. Passing either -v or --verbose on the command line will result in a more detailed logfile. Use --help for a complete list of options.\\nRegarding branches\\nThe master branch always contains stable code that passes the same tests as the most recent release, but it may have patches that were not included in that release. The default branch, develop, contains code that is still being tested and should not be used \"in production.\"\\nThe following command can be used to track and checkout master:\\ngit checkout -b master origin/master\\n\\nTo switch back to the development branch, use git checkout develop.\\nDocumentation\\n\\nHow to contribute\\nThe easiest way for Python developers to contribute is by fixing problems detected by QuantifiedCode, because the \"learn to fix\" link provides guidelines for resolving each issue. Click on the badge below to get started.\\n\\nDevelopers can also help by creating enhancements and new features; visit the project board on waffle.io to get an overview of development status.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to contribute but you\\'re not sure how to start, comment on the meta-issue for the current release and one of the project maintainers will be happy to help.\\nContributing terms\\nWhen you contribute to this project, you are sharing and/or creating content. Please do not contribute content unless you agree with the terms here.\\nCredits\\nComing soon\\nHistory\\nA detailed record of significant changes can be found in the changelog\\nLicense\\nUnlicense\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Our team includes developers, designers, a publisher, a curriculum writer and educators from Open Austin, the Austin Monitor, and Austin ISD.\\nWe are interested in the health of our civic fabric and we are excited about the potential for youth inclusion in the decision making process of local government.\\nThanks for coming here to learn more!\\nProject Description\\nBudget Party was built to help people understand and augment a city budget for Austin. It is an interactive app that is best used in context of a \"Budget Party\" event.\\nHistorically, Budget party events have 4 parts:\\n\\nA budget Overview. A quick presentation is given to people that primes them on the city budget, specifically the parts that citizens can influence.\\nBudget Party App Use. People get into small teams with neighbors to go through the app and allocate funds to different departments.\\nJudging A selection of people with real city budgeting experience judge the submitted budgets and choose a winner based on the night’s criteria.\\nPanel Discussion Once judging is done there is an open discussion on budgeting based on the submitted budgets, feasibility, and real world budgeting experience from the panelist/judges.\\n\\nRead about the history of Budget Party which includes information on the inception of the project and our Mozilla Grant funding.\\nWhat\\'s Next\\nThe Budget Party team is currently on pause. Budget season in Austin is over for 2017 but we are working to evaluate how best to move forward with the project to be ready for the 2018 budget season.\\nGot an idea? Reach out to the team! Community feedback is valuable in helping us evaluate our next steps. How can we make Budget Party more valuable for you?\\nContributing\\nThis project has received contributions from some wonderful volunteers. We would love to add your name to the list below. Over the course of this project, we have opportunities to help with design, development, QA & testing, writing, and more.

The feeder is not part of the Rails application (this repository) - instead, the Rails app has an API that provides access to update our database of missing animals, and external scripts are handling the nasty business of scraping external sources. The current Pet Harbor feeder is a Ruby script using soda to access the data.\\nNotifications are being sent to subscribers via email and text message for any new animals logged on AAC.\\nInstallation\\nNOTE: We temporarily discourage the use of vagrant for this project - it's too slow to be feasible.\\nLocal\\n\\nMake sure you have Ruby 2.1.3 installed (RVM or rubyenv make this easy)\\nMake sure you have Bundler installed\\n$ git clone git@github.com:open-austin/pet-finder.git\\n$ bundle install\\n$ rake db:migrate\\n$ rails server\\nVisit localhost:3000 to view the site in the browser.\\n\\nVagrant\\n\\n\\nMake sure you have VirtualBox installed.\\n\\n\\nMake sure you have vagrant installed.\\n\\n\\n$ git clone git@github.com:open-austin/pet-finder.git\\n\\n\\n$ vagrant up\\n\\n\\nNote that you will likely have to enter your password at some point to enable NFS - this is bypassable by sourceing the following from vagrant's docs:\\n  Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD = /usr/bin/tee -a /etc/exports\\n  Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_NFSD = /sbin/nfsd restart\\n  Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE = /usr/bin/sed -E -e /*/ d -ibak /etc/exports\\n  %admin ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD, VAGRANT_NFSD, VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVisit localhost:3000 to view the site in the browser.\\n\\n\\nConfiguration\\nWe are using Figaro to manage secret configuration settings - all this means for you is that you should create an application.yml file in config/ that looks like the following:\\nGMAIL_USERNAME: [working gmail address]\\nGMAIL_PASSWORD: [working gmail password]\\n\\nhttp_username: username\\nhttp_password: password\\n\\naws_key: [request a key]\\naws_secret: [request a secret]\\ns3_bucket: pet-alert-dev\\n\\nplivo_auth_id: auth-id\\nplivo_auth_token: auth-token\\nplivo_number: 1231231234\\n\\nEmail services\\nAll emails are sent from a background service called Sidekiq that will be installed alongside the rest of the gems - however, Sidekiq requires redis in order to function properly.\\n\\nInstall redis\\n$ redis-server\\n$ bundle exec sidekiq -q notifier -q default\\n\\nSMS services\\nWe are using Plivo to send SMS messages - if you need to test this locally, you will need to request an auth id and token from us. Generally, this shouldn't be necessary - the message sending part of the app is taken care of.\\nContributing\\nTo contribute, fork this repo and submit pull requests for merges. All updates should have accompanying tests (we use RSpec), and should ensure that all existing tests are passing. We are still establishing coding standards and practices, so do your best to contribute code that is as consistent as possible with things now.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

We want to help citizen, government, and nonprofit stakeholders solve problems.\\nOpen Austin is an open source organization. We make our projects freely and openly available. GitHub is where we collaborate. There are some really handy tools here, including a feature called Issues. This is where we can break projects into manageable problems for collaborators to solve together.\\nWe hope you find what you\\'re looking for, but if you need help, you can email us here!\\nThanks for co-creating with us!\\nHow To Propose or Discuss Project Ideas\\nGitHub Issues work just like any other commenting system on the Internet.\\nFirst, you\\'ll need to create an account.\\nThen you have two options:\\nComment on an existing idea (a.k.a. \"issue\")\\nScroll through the issues list first to see if anyone\\'s already thinking the same way! If you see an idea that catches your eye, click on it, read the discussion, and then add your thoughts to the bottom of the discussion thread. If you see the Needs Leadership label, bring it up at a hack night, and if you\\'re up for it you can take the lead on it!\\nOr, create a new idea.\\nIf you don\\'t see the idea you have in mind, add a new one. You\\'ll need a title and description. Someone from the Open Austin Core Team will respond, likely with some questions or feedback, and assign you to the issue to indicate you are leading the effort.\\nHere\\'s a quick video intro on using Github Issues for discussion.\\nNext Steps\\n\\n\\nPlease make a status update to your issues at least once a month to keep others informed. If we don\\'t hear from you after some time, we might assume you\\'ve moved on and will ask others to take the lead.\\n\\n\\nIf nobody\\'s talking yet, it might be that your idea needs some more fleshing out. We highly recommend thinking through the Civic Tech Canvas as a next step!\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to be the champion on this project, you should let one of our project leads know. GitHub is the platform we\\'re using to collect and vet ideas and then convert them into active projects. Once a project becomes active, we\\'ll help you set up a repository on the Open Austin GitHub organization so you can start scoping and collaborating. We\\'ll continue to use the Issues feature on your own project repo to flag obstacles, opportunities, and answer questions about that specific project. We will then add the project repo link to your idea issue and close it, indicating your graduation from idea to an active project.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The Mission:FakeNews team will develop a web app version of the Kraken the Code Web Literacy Exercise.\\nLesson #2: Rewriting History\\nThe goal of Lesson 2 is to help students better understand how fake new is produced and how it is spread. Students will have the opportunity to deconstruct fake news and to explore the techniques people use to create fake news, and the consequences of those techniques.\\nLesson #3: Run the Presses\\nThe goal of the Lesson 3 is to put students in the editor’s chair and give them a chance to make decisions common in news organizations, and to experience the consequences of those decisions. With this lesson, students will gain a deeper understanding of how fake news fits in a broader news and information ecosystem.\\nContact\\n\\nAshley Fisher, Austin Monitor\\nSarah Morris, Nucleus Learning Network\\nMateo Clarke, Open Austin & Civic Party Software\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The most important thing you can do is simplify your projects as much as possible. This repository was created as part of an unconference at the Code for America 2015 Summit.\\nHave anything to add? Fork this repo and open a pull request.\\nThis repo consists of three parts:\\n\\nGuidelines\\nExamples of projects that do a good job making themselves easy to fork\\nREADME Template\\n\\nGuidelines\\nSimplify your app as much as possible\\n\\nReduce the number of dependencies\\n\\nDo you really need mongo and memcached?\\nDo you even need a server?\\nCan your app just be static HTML + JS files hosted on GitHub Pages?\\n\\n\\nUse simple, easy-to-deploy technology\\n\\nTools like Travis CI make deployment public. Anybody can look at the build history and figure out how things are built.\\n\\n\\nDeploy-This buttons\\n\\nDeploy to Heroku button\\n\\n\\n\\nPut yourself in your forker’s shoes\\n\\nInline documentation, explain your thinking.\\nUser Context. Anything to better understand the intended users, uses, usage.\\n\\nLicenses and Copyright\\n\\n Choose a license and add it to your repo. ChooseALicense.com can help you choose a license. We recommend dedicating your work to the public domain. Why? The MIT, GPL, and other popular licenses don\\'t answer the question of copyright.\\n Don\\'t put copyright 2015 John, Jane, Bob, etc. on every page (or even anywhere in the app). As somebody forking the repo, I don\\'t want to put your name on every page. Will you be offended that I\\'m removing yourname?\\n\\nAdmit your mistakes\\n\\n Are you unhappy with the architecture or the code of your app? Say so in the README or an issue (and explain why). People trying to fork your app may encounter some of these same problems and have solutions. Or they may just give up.\\n\\nTalk about your data\\n\\n What is the minimum amount of data needed to get the project running?\\n List all the data the app uses, where it comes from, and how it is used.\\n Sample data, please.\\n Tests and test data, if you used them.\\n\\nREADME.md\\nSee the README-template.md.\\n\\n Brief description of what the project does and why it exists. Explain why would someone else care.\\n Include screenshots of the project so people can see the project in action without figuring out how to use it.\\n Include a link to the project.\\n Specify a maintainer.\\n\\nINSTALL.md\\nBy default, include installation instructions in the README. Consider moving the instructions to a INSTALL.md if the instructions are very long and distract from the rest of the README.\\n\\n Use your languages package management tools. Avoid asking people to install them by hand. Be sure to use very specific version numbers (6.6.6 is much better than just 6).\\n\\nPython: requirements.txt\\nJavaScript: package.json\\nRuby: Gemfile\\nGo:  (Check in your dependencies, I guess)\\n\\n\\n List dependencies that have to be manually installed. Link to useful guides on setting them up. Examples include Postgres, ...\\n Test your installation and deployment instructions on a clean machine.\\n CHANGELOG.md\\n\"It is a good idea to keep a changelog. http://keepachangelog.com (is a project on GitHub). \"\\n\\nSee https://github.com/cfpb/qu and https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-explorer\\nSome Inspiration: http://keepachangelog.com/\\n\\n\\n\\nBe easy to contact\\n\\nAnswer/use GitHub issues\\nAdd an email to the README, or add emails to your GitHub profile\\nSpecify a maintainer, and make sure the maintainer has an easy to find email\\nIf your brigade or project has a Slack channel, add a link to it.\\n\\nCode Style\\n\\nFormat code consistently and follow a popular styleguide.\\n\\nJavaScript\\n\\nJS Standard Style\\nAirbnb JavaScript Style Guide\\nESLint\\n\\n\\nPython\\n\\nPEP8\\npyflakes\\n\\n\\nGo\\n\\ngofmt\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRepo Metadata\\n\\n\\n Fill out the Description on GitHub\\n Fill out the URL on GitHub\\n\\nConfiguration\\n\\n Keep your city specific configuration in one file\\n\\nFor example, if your app has a map with some initial coordinates, store those initial coordinates in a config file instead of making them difficult to find.\\n\\n\\n Move other hard-coded values to a settings file.\\n\\nExamples\\nSome apps that have been easy to fork:\\n\\nCutePetsBot - Forked over 40 times.

The annual appraisal roll consists of valuations of every parcel in the county, and includes details about the age and square footage of property improvements, the size and value of lots, jurisdictional taxing authorities, and much more.\\nWe are asking TCAD to make the data available in an open, usable format. Key issues with the current data delivery process are as follows:\\n\\n\\nTo obtain the appraisal roll data citizens must pay $80 per appraisal year. Electronic records are available dating back to 2007.\\n\\n\\nThe data are delivered to citizens in an MS database. This is an arcane, proprietary format that requires special software to view.\\n\\n\\nTCAD's own documentation explicitly states that some of the data are not available at all (even with purchase), due to the limitations of the MS Access format.\\n\\n\\nOther entities (including the City of Austin) have managed to obtain copies of the data in a format other than MS Access, yet the TCAD records office insists that the data are exclusively available in the MS Access format.\\n\\n\\nNeighboring appraisal districts have managed to provide this data for free, in an open format. For example, WCAD: http://www.wcad.org/public-data/downloads?id=343\\u2028\\n\\n\\nWe (Open Austin) have proposed a few solutions:\\n\\n\\nPublish the appraisal roll data on our own website for the public to download.\\n\\n\\nTCAD could partner with the City of Austin to have the data published on the city’s open data portal. I am a City of Austin employee and would be happy to connect TCAD staff with the City’s Open Data Team.\\n\\n\\nWe communicated these issues to TCAD Board of Directors chairperson Dick Lavine and the Chief Appraiser's executive assistant on April 10, 2017. Although Dick Lavine has expressed an interest in working with us, we have so far been unable to set up a follow-up meeting or get any response from the Chief Appraiser.\\nThe obvious next step is to attend a TCAD board meeting, but unfortunately these take place monthly on a weekday in an inaccessible part of town. Another approach would be to raise money to buy all the data, reformat it, and host it.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       " {'readme': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n        README.md\\n      \\n\\n\\nBrigades and Poltical Action\\nCode for America has gotten a number of questions about how Brigades should approach political activism given the current political situation in this country.\\nThe short answer is: People should always  do what they feel they need to do to be an actively engaged citizen. The tricky part is what’s advisable to do in the name of your Brigade, which is technically a program of Code for America. As a nonprofit nonpartisan organization, the IRS puts certain rules in place that limit what we can and can’t do. We’ve listed a few below.\\nTo be clear, you can always speak or act on your own behalf, as long as you’re not representing your Brigade or Code for America.\\nThings that your Brigade can do:\\n\\nPublicly comment and educate the general public and elected officials on key issues of importance to your organization.\\nAdvocate for or against specific public policies by speaking out on decisions made by government agencies, executives, or courts.\\nCall, write, and meet with elected officials to support or oppose specific pieces of legislation.\\nSponsor and distribute nonpartisan voter guides.\\nSurvey candidates and report where they stand on the survey.\\n\\nThings that Brigades can not do:\\n\\nThey can not endorse or oppose candidates who are running for public office.\\nThey can not advise members of your brigade chapter or the public at large, directly or indirectly, to vote for or against specific candidates or political parties.\\nThey can not make financial contributions to candidates.\\nThey can not make in-kind contributions (including use of Brigade infrastructure) to political campaigns. (They can’t eat food meant for Brigade actions)\\nThey can not collect money on behalf of, or provide in-kind services, to a candidate.\\nThey can not create political action committees.\\nThey can not distribute or display campaign literature or partisan voter guides.\\n\\nTo reiterate; you can totally do these things personally, as long as you’re not acting as your Brigade or as Code for America when you do so.\\nWhen to say yes and when to say no\\nSome good questions to ask when faced with a question about whether to participate:\\n\\nWill this move my Brigade’s goals forward??  There’s nothing wrong with going “We’d love to march, but aren't equipped to organize a march. Are you connected with X org?” OR “We can’t lead it, but we’ll let our members know about it.”\\nIs my Brigade equipped to respond appropriately? Do you have the resources? Do you and your volunteers have time?\\nIs there another organization already doing this work? Can you partner with them or direct your members their way?\\nDoes this align with my Brigade’s values?\\nEvery Brigade is different. Your values should reflect your membership. It’s a judgement call that your leadership team has to make.\\n\\nAll systems go? \\n\\nRemember to keep your Brigade’s  ‘voice’ steady and loud\\nWhen we say voice, we mean the tone and demeanor of your Brigade’s outbound communications. Words matter. Stay Positive: Code for America has always been about taking an active role in government to use our talents in a positive way. We’re for America not against a person who just happens to hold high office.\\nThis might mean re-wording language for certain calls to action. “Save the data” vs “Stop the deletion of data”\\nThis will also help to avoid violating our 501(c)3 by not being against any particular candidate.\\nGovernment agencies are our partners\\nRemember, there is more than one level of government.\\nA fan of your city? Reiterate a desire to help.\\nThe greatest office in a democracy is that of the citizen.\\nPeople want to be involved; your Brigade gives them one of many paths where they can do that.\\nReiterate your Brigade values early and often\\n\\nYour Brigade values are what makes you, you. While you may not be able to use the Brigade twitter account to directly lobby - you can use it as an opportunity to say “This is who we are and this is what we value.” You can always switch to your personal accounts when you want to get more partisan or forceful.\\nWhat are good actions to take as Brigades? \\n\\nSaving open government data to the Internet Archive\\nBrigade members have expertise on open data\\nIt matches your mission\\nIt’s nonpartisan\\nPartner with organizations to elevate voices from the community on various topics that matter to your members, such as   encryption, SMS messaging, government 101, or other aspects of governing. Your members may have an interest in learning more about a current newsworthy topic. Invite a speaker to your hacknight to share their knowledge. Being a civic technologists means knowing both sides of the house.\\nKeep calm and continue hacking\\nYour Brigade already makes your city stronger. You provide a space for people to engage with each other and leverage their technology skills to help their community. Building an app that gives people information about a law or government service.\\n\\nWhen you need a different type of superhero \\nNot everyone can be Batman. In fact, everyone trying to be Batman never turns out well. When looking at our current political climate and the challenges facing our cities,  it’s obvious that we’re going to need the whole Justice League.\\nIf you get a call to action (or want to take actions) that doesn’t sync up with the Brigade mission here are some places where you can volunteer or refer others too.\\n\\nTake off the track jacket and pick up a clipboard\\nYes, you could run for office. We know you love your city and your country. At least consider it.\\nVolunteer for a campaign\\nJoin a politically active meetup\\nMarch and protest\\nCall your elected officials\\nContribute and volunteer for nonprofits doing good work\\n\\nAs we get real world examples, we'll add these to the list. As always, if you have any questions please email christopher@codeforamerica.org\\nThe Brigade Team & the National Advisory Council\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

It is the city’s duty to ensure a system that embraces automation, ease and sustainability.\\nActions\\n1) Creation of CTTC Working Group - The City’s Community Technology & Telecommunications Commission (CTTC) will form a working group to draft a formal recommendation for an open data ordinance for presentation to the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee of the City Council.\\nRecommendations\\n\\n\\nData is Machine Readable - This means releasing information in open formats (or “open standards”), in machine-readable formats, that are structured (or machine-processable) appropriately. Plainly, “open formats” refer to a rolling set of “open standards,” often defined by standards organizations, that store information in a way that can be accessed by proprietary or non-proprietary software means. These formats exist across an array of data types; a common example cited is CSV in lieu of XLS for spreadsheets (the former being accessible via a wider variety of software mechanisms than the latter). “Machine-readability” simply refers to a format that a computer can understand. For example, .PDF formats for documents are not an idea format for machine readability.\\n\\n\\nData Catalog - For an open data policy to have a strong foundation, you first need to know what data you have—and so does the public. Governments should conduct an inventory of existing data early in the process of open data policy development in order for the government and other stakeholders to be aware of the full potential dimensions of data release. While defining total information holdings may be a complex undertaking, governments should conduct as comprehensive a review of existing data information as possible, with the inclusion of information holdings that may benefit from becoming structured data themselves.\\n\\n\\nPrioritize and Release - The The new working group will prioritize based on the catalog for the next year’s goals. As part of the first year’s guarantees, we recommend that one high value data set, based on community input, to be released under the new accessible guidelines.\\n\\n\\nLicensed Free - The City of Austin shall license any data it publishes for free re-use to ensure clarity of copyright without legal responsibility or liability for publishing such data.\\n\\n\\nContracted products and services must adhere - To ensure that the public retains access to its data, provisions should added whenever possible to the existing procurement, contracting or planning processes requiring government contractors release government relevant information openly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

You can install Node at their site or with a command like brew install node if you use Homebrew.\\n2. gulp is required\\ngulp is used to build and run the app. Before you can serve the app locally, you need to install gulp cli:\\n$ npm install -g gulp\\n\\n3. webpack is required\\nwebpack is used to bundle assets\\n$ npm install -g webpack\\n\\nTo bundle assets:\\n$ webpack\\n\\n4. install npm dependencies\\nInstall the npm dependencies:\\n$ npm install\\n\\n5. run the development server\\nTo run the local server and see the app in your browser:\\n$ npm start\\n\\nServes the app at http://localhost:8080.\\nTo (re)build data files:\\nThe data processing workflow is (for the most part) automated with a Makefile\\nin the data/ directory. This workflow assumes a UNIX operating system (such as\\nOS X or Linux). You\\'ll also need:\\n\\nnode / npm\\nruby\\nogr/gdal\\n\\nTo build data files, cd into the data/ directory:\\n$ cd data\\n\\nAnd run make\\n$ make\\n\\nIf you want to rebuild or update a file, just delete it and re-run make. At the\\nmoment, not everything has been ported over to the Makefile, so this won\\'t\\nwork for all files.\\nData sources & use:\\n\\nCity of Austin, Parks and Rec Dept (PARD) Data\\n\\nBasic Park Feature Layer via ArcGIS Server\\n\\nAlso available on data.austintexas.gov\\nThis data is used across the app to produce park shapes.\\n\\n\\nPark Amenity Points\\n\\nThis data is used to calculate whether a park is \"undeveloped\" or \"developed\".\\n\\n\\nPark Facility Points\\n\\nThis data is used to calculate whether a park is \"undeveloped\" or \"developed\".\\n\\n\\nPark Trails\\n\\n\\nOpen Street Map Park Data:\\n\\nWe use the Overpass API via the \"query-overpass\" plugin to extract data. Here\\'s the commit that added OSM data if you\\'re curious how.\\nWe use this data to expose privately owned but publicly accessible parks that PARD doesn\\'t maintain.\\n\\n\\nCensus.gov Data\\n\\nDistrict Demographic Data via City of Austin Demographer.\\nCitySDK API\\n\\nWe use this data to show park need and compare districts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArchitectural Decisions & Known Issues:\\n\\nOur javascript files are messy. Based on the way this project grew from one map to many, we are currently making a separate js file for each html page. This is bad and should eventually be fixed.\\nFor the park access heatmap, we ran a GIS process in ArcGIS. This static heatmap layer isn\\'t response to park layers being toggled on and off. We\\'ll probably use CartoDB to host these heatmaps in the future and rely on their PostGIS servers to create simplified buffers vs the cost-distance analysis heatmap we are currently working with.\\nQuestion about why or how we did something? Create an issue!\\n\\n##Credits\\n\\nMaintainer: @mateoclarke - dev\\n@kyoder - GIS Data Analysis\\n@wilsaj - GIS & dev\\n@fremn - dev\\n@luqmaan - dev\\n@mattybow - dev\\n@johntryee - dev\\n\\nUnlicense:\\nReleased to the public domain under the Unlicense by Open Austin, 2015.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The software can\\nbe used to generate reports for local filing, but does not support electronic filing locally.\\nThe state software allows import of contributions and expenditures. Our tool will be\\nmodeled around this import format. It is documented in the TX-CFA Import Guide:\\nhttp://www.ethics.state.tx.us/whatsnew/ImportGuide.pdf\\nDevelopment Status\\nThere is currently a prototype \"import engine\" that would load CSV files in a standard form\\ndefined by the TEC, save them in a database, and (if desired) produce the standard TEC forms as PDFs.\\nNow that we\\'ve got a workable data model and PDF rendering tool, we\\'d like to build a web-based app.\\nWhen complete, this will provide a complete solution for campaigns to file their financial reports,\\nand provide public transparency to funds in the political system.\\nThe import engine is written in ruby, and the web framework has been created in rails.\\nThey need to be merged.\\nInstallation Notes\\nThese instructions will help get the rails web framework installed. The import engine\\ncurrently lives in the dm-import-engine branch.\\ngit clone https://github.com/chip-rosenthal/tecfiler.git\\ncd tecfiler\\nbundle install\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy config/database_example.yml to database.yml and edit it for your preferred db.\\n\\n\\nCopy config/email_example.yml to email.yml and edit it for your email server settings. Devise is configured to require account confirmation via email.\\n\\n\\nMigrate the database:\\nbundle exec rake db:migrate\\n\\n\\nStart the web server:\\nrails server\\n\\n\\nGo to http://localhost:3000/\\n\\n\\nAdmin interface is at http://localhost:3000/admin (demo account login is \"admin@example.com\" and password is \"password\")\\n\\n\\nUnit Tests\\nYou can run the unit tests by running:\\nbundle exec rspec spec/models\\n\\nAt this time, only \"models\" tests are implemented. You may encounter failures\\nif you try to run the entire \"spec\" suite.\\nYou can perform all tests in a single spec file with a command such as:\\nbundle exec rspec spec/models/contribution_spec.rb\\n\\nor a single test case by including a line number, such as:\\nbundle exec rspec spec/models/contribution_spec.rb:14\\n\\nAn in-memory database is used for test mode (RAILS_ENV=\"test\"). This speeds\\nup testing a bit. (But not enough, it still takes a painful amount of time\\nto bring up the Rails stack for testing.)\\nProduction Notes\\nBefore running in a production environment, be sure to update the secret token to a unique value:\\nrake secret\\n\\nEdit your config/initializers/secret_token.rb file to add the secret token:\\nTecfilerAr::Application.config.secret_token = \\'...some really long, random string...\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Getting Started\\nFind park data: The first thing you should do is look for park data from your city. Many cities and counties have a data portal. In Austin, we found raw park GIS data through the City\\'s Socrata Open Data Portal.\\nOften times, this data will be in a format best for analysis with desktop GIS software. For this web map, the ideal data type is geojson. But if it is in Shapefile format, that is ok too. But we\\'ll worry about converting the file type later. Check out this blog post to learn why .geojson is nice and to learn how to convert data into geojson.\\nFork the repo: Did you find a .geojson, .json, .shp (Shapefile), or .kml file with park polygons? Awesome. We\\'ll make sure to convert that data into the best format in a later step. Now, you should go ahead and fork this repo to your own Github account. Once you\\'ve forked the repo and cloned it down from your own Github repo to your local machine, go ahead and follow the steps below...\\nIf you couldn\\'t find some park data, but you still want to play along. Try using this data from Oakland.\\n2. Running Code Locally\\n1. npm is required\\nnpm is Node\\'s package manager. You can install Node at their site or with a command like brew install node if you use Homebrew.\\n2. webpack is required\\nwebpack is used to bundle assets\\n$ npm install -g webpack\\n\\n3. install npm dependencies\\nInstall the npm dependencies:\\n$ npm install\\n\\n4. run the build system && development server\\nTo bundle assets, run the local server and see the app in your browser:\\n$ npm start\\n\\nNPM will serve the app at http://localhost:8080.\\n3. Import you own park data\\nBack in Step 1, we wanted to make sure you could find park data from your city. Now\\'s the time to import it into the app. We save our GIS file into a directory called /data. See that directory here on Github. Now that your raw data is imported, its time to convert your data to .geojson (if its not already). I suggest you follow the instructions in this blog if you haven\\'t used ogr2ogr or coverted Shapefiles to geojson before. Last step here, rename your file to parks.geojson. This is what the code is expecting that park layer to be called. You\\'ll need to either delete or rename the Austin park layer that came down with the repo.\\n4. Config and customize the app to your city\\nUpdate the config file. Go into the config file and update things like the coordinates of your city and your own CitySDK token (which you should request here).\\nBuild new features. Add new features. The main javascript code live in the js/app.js file\\nAustin Data Sources\\n\\nCity of Austin, Parks and Recreation Department (PARD) Data\\n\\nBasic Park Feature Layer via ArcGIS Server\\n\\nAlso available on data.austintexas.gov\\nThis data is used across the app to produce park shapes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGlobal Data Sources\\n\\nOpen Street Map Park Data:\\n\\nWe use the Overpass API via the \"query-overpass\" plugin to extract data. Here\\'s the commit that added OSM data if you\\'re curious how.\\n\\n\\nCensus.gov Data\\n\\nCitySDK API\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlicense\\nReleased to the public domain under the Unlicense by Open Austin, 2015.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " {'readme': '\\n\\n\\n\\n        README.md\\n      \\n\\n\\nAustin Recycles\\nAbout\\n\"Austin Recycles\" consists of a web application plus a web service that\\nprovides trash and recycling pickup information for the City of Austin.\\nMore info here: http://atxhack.wikispaces.com/Austin+Recycles\\nDemo site: http://austin-recycles.open-austin.org/\\nIssues and support queue: https://github.com/open-austin/austin-recycles/issues\\nUsage\\nFirst start the web service.  For development, run \"bin/austin-recycles\" from\\na command line. For production, run via Phusion Passenger.\\nThen, browse the \"index.html\" page.\\nRequirements\\nAt this time, the \"findit-support\" package must be manually installed\\ninto the vendor directory. See: vendor/README\\nThe SPATIALITE path may need to be specifically set when running the service:\\nSPATIALITE=/usr/local/opt/libspatialite/lib/libspatialite.dylib bin/austin-recycles\\n\\nFor more information, see: vendor/findit-support/README.rdoc\\nWeb Service API:\\nThe web service provides a simple interface to retrieve service information\\nfor a given location. The location is specified as degrees latitude and\\nlongitude.\\nHere is an example:\\nREQUEST:\\nGET http://localhost:4567/svc?latitude=30.362&longitude=-97.734 \\n\\nRESPONSE:\\n{\\n   \"origin\" : {\\n      \"longitude\" : -97.734,\\n      \"latitude\" : 30.362\\n   }\\n   \"routes\" : {\\n      \"bulky\" : {\\n         \"route\" : \"BU30\",\\n         \"type\" : \"BULKY\",\\n         \"next_service\" : {\\n            \"period\" : \"WEEK\",\\n            \"timestamp\" : 1376197200000,\\n            \"status\" : \"PENDING\",\\n            \"date\" : \"08/11/2013\",\\n            \"day\" : \"Sun\",\\n            \"slip\" : null\\n         }\\n      },\\n      \"brush\" : {\\n         \"route\" : \"BR22\",\\n         \"type\" : \"BRUSH\",\\n         \"next_service\" : {\\n            \"period\" : \"WEEK\",\\n            \"timestamp\" : 1368334800000,\\n            \"status\" : \"PAST\",\\n            \"date\" : \"05/12/2013\",\\n            \"day\" : \"Sun\",\\n            \"slip\" : null\\n         }\\n      },\\n      \"recycle\" : {\\n         \"route\" : \"RHAU14\",\\n         \"type\" : \"RECYCLE\",\\n         \"next_service\" : {\\n            \"period\" : \"DAY\",\\n            \"timestamp\" : 1371704400000,\\n            \"status\" : \"PENDING\",\\n            \"date\" : \"06/20/2013\",\\n            \"day\" : \"Thu\",\\n            \"slip\" : null\\n         }\\n      },\\n      \"yard_trimming\" : {\\n         \"route\" : \"HY10\",\\n         \"type\" : \"YARD_TRIMMING\",\\n         \"next_service\" : {\\n            \"period\" : \"DAY\",\\n            \"timestamp\" : 1371099600000,\\n            \"status\" : \"PENDING\",\\n            \"date\" : \"06/13/2013\",\\n            \"day\" : \"Thu\",\\n            \"slip\" : null\\n         }\\n      },\\n      \"garbage\" : {\\n         \"route\" : \"PAH60\",\\n         \"type\" : \"GARBAGE\",\\n         \"next_service\" : {\\n            \"period\" : \"DAY\",\\n            \"timestamp\" : 1371099600000,\\n            \"status\" : \"PENDING\",\\n            \"date\" : \"06/13/2013\",\\n            \"day\" : \"Thu\",\\n            \"slip\" : null\\n         }\\n      }\\n   },\\n}\\n\\nFor each route, the \"next_service\" fields indicate:\\n\\ntimestamp - The service date, milliseconds since epoch.\\nperiod - Either DAY (the timestamp indicates the day on which service should occur)\\nor WEEK (the timestamp indicates the start of the week in which service should occur)\\ndate - Printable date, from the service date.\\nday - Printable day of week, from the service date.\\nstatus - ACTIVE (the service is happening now or about to happen), PENDING (the service\\nis in the future), or PAST (the service has already occurred).\\nslip - Number of days the service has slipped due to a holiday, or \"null\" if no slip.\\n\\nHelpful notes\\nInstalling findit-support and spatialite\\nCheck the \"vendor/README\" file for instructions for installing the findit-support package.\\nQuery parameters for debug\\nYou can add query parameters to the application to assist in debugging. Example:\\nhttp://localhost/index.html?svc=http://austin-recycles.open-austin.org/svc&delay=5\\n\\nThe supported parameters are:\\n\\n\\nsvc -- URL of the web service. By default, the web service URL is calculated\\nfrom the document URL, i.e. the web service is assumed to be running on the\\nsame server as the application. You may want to use this, for instance, if you\\nare debugging the application locally, but want to use an instance of the web\\nservice elsewhere.\\n\\n\\ndelay -- A delay (in seconds) added for web service responses. The delay value\\nis passed to the web service, which will delay by that amount before responding.\\nI\\'ve used this, for instance, when I wanted to verify that the \"busy throbber\" is\\ndisplaying correctly.\\n\\n\\nt -- Value to use for current date. Must be a valid Date.parse() value, such as\\n\"?t=July+3,+2014\".\\n\\n\\nstatus -- Override calculated status of a service. The format is \"id:status[,id:status...]\".\\nExample usage: http://stuff?status=recycle:active,bulky:past\\nValid id values are: garbage, yard_trimming, recycle, brush, bulky.\\nValid status values are: active, pending, past.\\n\\n\\nDatabase browser\\nIf you are working with the web service, you may want a tool to browse the database.\\nThe SpatiaLite GUI app is a good tool. You also can use a SQLite tool, even though the\\ngeometry columns will just appear as blobs. One option is:\\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
